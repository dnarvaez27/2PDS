Diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis is best accomplished by combining clinical judgment with diagnostic test results, the criterion standard of which is the throat culture. Penicillin (either oral penicillin V or injectable benzathine penicillin) is the treatment of choice, because it is cost-effective, has a narrow spectrum of activity, and has long-standing proven efficacy, and GAS resistant to penicillin have not been documented. For penicillin-allergic individuals, acceptable alternatives include a narrow-spectrum oral cephalosporin, oral clindamycin, or various oral macrolides or azalides. The individual who has had an attack of rheumatic fever is at very high risk of developing recurrences after subsequent GAS pharyngitis and needs continuous antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent such recurrences (secondary prevention). The recommended duration of prophylaxis depends on the number of previous attacks, the time elapsed since the last attack, the risk of exposure to GAS infections, the age of the patient, and the presence or absence of cardiac involvement. Penicillin is again the agent of choice for secondary prophylaxis, but sulfadiazine or a macrolide or azalide are acceptable alternatives in penicillin-allergic individuals. This report updates the 1995 statement by the American Heart Association Rheumatic Fever, Endocarditis, and Kawasaki Disease Committee. It includes new recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of GAS pharyngitis, as well as for the secondary prevention of rheumatic fever, and classifies the strength of the recommendations and level of evidence supporting them. <b>(</b><b><i>Circulation</i></b><b>. 2009;119:1541-1551.)\n</b></p><p><b>Key Words: </b>AHA Scientific Statements   pediatrics   infectious diseases   prevention   rheumatic heart disease   rheumatic fever   streptococcal pharyngitis\n</p><h1><p>T</p></h1><p>his scientific statement is an update of a 1995 statementon prevention of rheumatic fever by this committee.1\n</p><p>Prevention of both initial and recurrent attacks of rheumatic fever depends on control of group A  -hemolytic streptococ-\n</p><p>cal (GAS) tonsillopharyngitis (strep throat).

Physicians practicing in areas outside the United States with a higher incidence of acute rheumatic fever or in areas of the United States experiencing an outbreak of acute rheumatic fever need to take this into consideration.\n</p><p>The writing group was charged with the task of performing an assessment of the evidence and assigning a classification of recommendations and a level of evidence (LOE) to each recommendation. The American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association (AHA) classification system was used as follows:\n</p><p><b>Classification of Recommendations:\n</b></p><p>Class I: Conditions for which there is evidence and/or general agreement that a given procedure or treatment is beneficial, useful, and effective.\n</p><p>Class II: Conditions for which there is conflicting evidence and/or a divergence of opinion about the usefulness/ efficacy of a procedure or treatment.\n</p><p>Class IIa: Weight of evidence/opinion is in favor of usefulness/efficacy.\n</p><p>Class IIb: Usefulness/efficacy is less well established by evidence/opinion.\n</p><p>Class III: Conditions for which there is evidence and/or general agreement that a procedure/treatment is not useful/ effective and in some cases may be harmful.\n</p><p><b>Level of Evidence:\n</b></p><p>Level of Evidence A: Data derived from multiple randomized clinical trials or meta-analyses.\n</p><p>Level of Evidence B: Data derived from a single randomized trial or nonrandomized studies.\n</p><p>Level of Evidence C: Only consensus opinion of experts, cases studies, or standard of care. least one third of episodes of acute rheumatic fever result from inapparent streptococcal infections.14 In addition, some symptomatic patients do not seek medical care. In these instances, rheumatic fever is not preventable.\n</p><p><b>Diagnosis of Streptococcal Infections\n</b></p><p>Prevention of initial episodes of acute rheumatic fever requires accurate recognition and proper antibiotic treatment of GAS pharyngitis. Streptococcal skin infections (impetigo or pyoderma) have not been proven to lead to acute rheumatic fever and are not discussed here. Acute pharyngitis is caused considerably more often by viruses than by bacteria. Viruses that commonly cause pharyngitis include influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Epstein-Barr virus, enteroviruses, and herpesviruses. Other causes of acute pharyngitis include groups C and G streptococci, <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i>, <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i>, <i>Chlamydia pneumoniae</i>, <i>Arcanobacterium hemo-lyticum</i>, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n</p><p>GAS pharyngitis is primarily a disease of children 5 to 15 years of age, and in temperate climates, it usually occurs in the winter and early spring. GAS is an uncommon cause of pharyngitis in preschool children, but outbreaks in child care settings have been reported.15,16 However, rheumatic fever is rare in children younger than 3 years of age in the United States. Initial attacks of rheumatic fever are also rare in adults, but recurrences are well documented.\n</p><p>Clinical findings suggestive of GAS as the cause of an episode of acute pharyngitis (Table 1) include sore throat (generally of sudden onset), pain on swallowing, fever of varying degree (usually from 101°F to 104°F), and headache; abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting may also occur, especially in children. Additional clinical findings include tonsillopharyngeal erythema with or without exudates, anterior cervical lymphadenitis, soft palate petechiae, beefy red swollen uvula, and a scarlatiniform rash. None of these clinical manifestations individually is specific enough to diagnose GAS pharyngitis, and these clinical signs and symptoms can occur with other upper respiratory tract infections. These clinical findings are noted primarily in children older than 3 years of age and in adults. Clinical findings in younger children can be different and less specific. For example, infants with GAS upper respiratory tract infections may present with excoriated nares or purulent nasal discharge. A history of close contact with a well-documented case of GAS pharyngitis may be helpful in making the diagnosis, as is an awareness of a high prevalence of GAS infections in the community. Clinical findings highly suggestive of a viral cause of an episode of acute pharyngitis include coryza, hoarseness, cough, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, and a\n</p><p> by guest on N\n</p><p>ovem\n</p><p>ber 14, 2017\n</p><p>http://circ.ahajournals.org/ D ow\n</p><p>nloaded from\n</p><p><b>(Class I, LOE B)</b>.17 Neither the blood agar plate culture nor the RADT can accurately differentiate individuals with bona fide GAS pharyngitis from GAS carriers (defined as individuals with positive throat cultures for GAS without an immunologic response to GAS) with intercurrent viral pharyngitis. However, they do facilitate the withholding of antibiotics from the great majority of patients with sore throats, whose cultures or RADTs are negative, and this is extremely important. Pharyngeal carriage of GAS is a common finding, particularly in school-age children. In the winter and early spring, as many as 15% of school-age children may be asymptomatic GAS carriers.18\n</p><p>When deciding whether to perform a microbiological test for a patient with acute pharyngitis, the clinical and epidemiological findings in Table 1 need to be considered <b>(Class I, LOE B)</b>. If these findings are suggestive of GAS pharyngitis, then a throat culture or RADT should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. It is easier to exclude the diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis accurately than it is to establish the diagnosis accurately. Therefore, for patients with acute pharyngitis and clinical and epidemiological findings suggestive of a viral origin, the pretest probability initial attack of acute rheumatic fever is extremely low in adults, even those with an undiagnosed and untreated episode of GAS pharyngitis. Therefore, the use of a clinical algorithm without microbiological confirmation has been recommended recently by some authors as an acceptable strategy for diagnosing GAS pharyngitis in adults but not children.19 However, use of this approach could result in the receipt of inappropriate antimicrobial therapy by an unacceptably large number of adults with nonstreptococcal pharyngitis and is not recommended <b>(Class III, LOE B)</b>.17,20,21\n</p><p><b>Throat Culture\n</b></p><p>Throat culture is the conventional method for establishing the diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis and is the criterion standard. In an untreated patient with GAS pharyngitis, a properly obtained (by vigorous swabbing of both tonsils and posterior pharynx) throat culture is almost always positive; however, a positive throat culture may reflect chronic colonization by GAS, and the acute illness may be caused by another agent. Quantitation of GAS from the throat swab culture cannot be used to differentiate carriage from infection, because sparse growth may be associated with true infection. A negative throat culture permits the physician to withhold antibiotic therapy from the large majority of patients with sore throats.\n</p><p><b>Antigen Detection Tests\n</b></p><p>Many GAS antigen detection tests are available commercially. These tests vary in method. Most of these tests have a high degree of specificity, but their sensitivity in clinical practice can be unacceptably low. Therefore, treatment is indicated for the patient with acute pharyngitis who has a positive RADT <b>(Class I, LOE B)</b>. As with the throat culture, a positive RADT may reflect chronic colonization by GAS, and the acute illness may be caused by another agent. With most RADTs, a negative test does not exclude the presence of GAS, and a throat culture should be performed <b>(Class I, LOE B)</b>.17,22 Newer tests have been developed that may be more sensitive than other RADTs and perhaps even as sensitive as blood agar plate cultures.23,24 However, the definitive studies to determine whether some RADTs are significantly more sensitive than others and whether any of the RADTs are sensitive enough to be used routinely in children without throat culture confirmation of negative test results have not been performed.

When present, elevated or rising antistreptococcal antibody titers provide reliable confirmation of a recent GAS infection and are of value in identifying a preceding GAS infection in a patient suspected of having rheumatic fever. The most commonly used and commercially available antibody assays are antistreptolysin O and antideoxyribonuclease B. These tests are valuable in patients who have possible nonsuppura-tive complications of GAS infections (acute rheumatic fever or acute glomerulonephritis). The antistreptolysin O test is usually obtained first, and if it is not elevated, an antideoxyri-bonuclease B test may be performed. Antistreptolysin O titers begin to rise approximately 1 week and peak 3 to 6 weeks after the infection. Antideoxyribonuclease B titers begin to rise 1 to 2 weeks and peak 6 to 8 weeks after the infection. Elevated titers for both tests may persist for several months after even uncomplicated GAS infections.\n</p><p>It is not uncommon for laboratory personnel and physicians to misinterpret streptococcal antibody titers because of a failure to lems when interpreting the results of streptococcal serological testing performed on their patients.\n</p><p>A commercially available slide agglutination test for the detection of antibodies to several streptococcal antigens is the Streptozyme test (Wampole Laboratories, Stamford, Conn). This test is less well standardized and less reproducible than other antibody tests, and it should not be used as a test for evidence of a preceding GAS infection <b>(Class III, LOE B)</b>.27,28\n</p><p><b>Recommended Treatment Schedules\n</b></p><p>Prevention of rheumatic fever requires adequate therapy for GAS pharyngitis. In selecting a regimen for the treatment of GAS pharyngitis, physicians should consider various factors, including bacteriologic and clinical efficacy, ease of adherence to the recommended regimen (frequency of daily administration, duration of therapy, and palatability), cost, spectrum of activity of the selected agent, and potential side effects. No regimen eradicates GAS from the pharynx in 100% of treated patients, even though 100% of GAS demonstrate in vitro susceptibility to all  -lactam agents (penicillins and cephalosporins).\n</p><p>Intramuscular benzathine penicillin G and oral penicillin V are the recommended antimicrobial drugs for the treatment of GAS, except in individuals with histories of penicillin allergy (<b>Class I, LOE B</b>; Table 2).

Even when started as long as 9 days after the onset of acute illness, penicillin effectively prevents primary attacks of rheumatic fever.31 Therefore, a 24- to 48-hour delay to process the throat culture before antibiotic therapy is started does not increase the risk of rheumatic fever. However, early diagnosis (eg, by rapid antigen test) and therapy may reduce the period of infectivity and morbidity, which would allow the patient to return to normal activity sooner. Patients are considered no longer contagious after 24 hours of antibiotic therapy.32\n</p><p><b>Oral Penicillins\n</b></p><p>The oral antibiotics of choice are penicillin V and amoxicillin (Table 2). Comparative clinical trials used penicillin V dosages of 40 mg/kg (not to exceed 750 mg for those weighing  27 kg) per 24 hours, given in 3 equally divided doses. Generally, 250 mg 2 times daily is recommended for most children <b>(Class I, LOE B)</b>.33,34 Little information is available about comparable penicillin doses in adults. A dose of 500 mg 2 to 3 times daily is recommended for adolescents and adults <b>(Class I, LOE B)</b>. All patients should continue to take penicillin regularly for an entire 10-day period, even though they likely will be asymptomatic after the first few days <b>(Class I, LOE A)</b>. Penicillin V is preferred to penicillin G because it is more resistant to gastric acid. An oral, time-released formulation of amoxicillin (Moxatag; Middle-Brook Pharmaceuticals, Westlake, Tex) was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for once-daily therapy of GAS pharyngitis in those 12 years of age and older. In comparative clinical trials, once-daily amoxicillin (50 mg/kg, maximum 1000 mg) for 10 days has been shown to be effective for GAS pharyngitis <b>(Class I, LOE B)</b>.35-38 This somewhat broader-spectrum agent has the advantage of once-daily dosing, which may enhance adherence, and is relatively inexpensive, and amoxicillin suspension is considerably more palatable than penicillin V suspension.\n</p><p><b>Intramuscular Benzathine Penicillin G\n</b></p><p>Benzathine penicillin G should be considered particularly for patients who are unlikely to complete a 10-day course of oral therapy and for patients with personal or family histories of rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease or environmental factors (such as crowded living conditions or low socioeconomic status) that place them at enhanced risk for rheumatic fever <b>(Class IIa, LOE B)</b>.39-42 Benzathine penicillin G 300 000 U of procaine penicillin G (Bicillin C-R 900/300) is satisfactory therapy for most smaller children.43 The efficacy of this combination for heavier patients such as large teenagers or adults requires further study.\n</p><p>Allergic reactions to penicillin are more common in adults than in children. Reactions occur in only a small percentage of patients, are more frequent after injection, and include urticaria and angioneurotic edema. A serum sickness-like reaction characterized by fever and joint pain may be mistaken for acute rheumatic fever. Anaphylaxis is rare, especially in children. A careful history regarding allergic reactions to penicillin should be obtained.\n</p><p><b>Other Antimicrobial Agents\n</b></p><p><b><i>Oral Cephalosporins\n</i></b></p><p>A 10-day course of a narrow-spectrum oral cephalosporin is recommended for most penicillin-allergic individuals <b>(Class I, LOE B)</b>. Several reports indicate that a l0-day course with an oral cephalosporin is superior to 10 days of oral penicillin in eradicating GAS from the pharynx.44-47 Analysis of these data suggest that the difference in eradication is due mainly to a higher rate of eradication of carriers included unintentionally in these clinical trials. Narrow-spectrum cephalosporins such as cefadroxil or cephalexin are much preferred to broad-spectrum cephalosporins such as cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefixime, cefdinir, and cefpodoxime. Some penicillin-allergic persons (up to 10%) are also allergic to cephalosporins, and these agents should not be used in patients with immediate (anaphylactic-type) hypersensitivity to penicillin.48\n</p><p>Most oral broad-spectrum cephalosporins are considerably more expensive than penicillin or amoxicillin, and the former agents are more likely to select for antibiotic-resistant flora. Other reports suggest that a 5-day course with selected oral broad-spectrum cephalosporins is comparable to a 10-day course of oral penicillin in eradicating GAS from the pharynx.49-52 Some of these regimens are not currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and further studies are warranted to expand and confirm these observations before these shorter-course regimens can be recommended.\n</p><p><b><i>Oral Clindamycin\n</i></b></p><p>Clindamycin resistance among GAS isolates in the United States is  1%, and this is a reasonable agent for treating penicillin-allergic patients (<b>Class IIa, LOE B</b>; Table 2).\n</p><p><b><i>Macrolides\n</i></b></p><p>The use of an oral macrolide (erythromycin or clarithromy-cin) or azalide (azithromycin) is reasonable for patients allergic to penicillins <b>(Class IIa, LOE B)</b>.

Tetracyclines should not be used because of the high prevalence of resistant strains <b>(Class III, LOE B)</b>. Sulfonamides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole do not eradicate GAS in patients with pharyngitis and should not be used to treat active infections\n<b>(Class III, LOE B)</b>.58 Older fluoroquinolones (eg, ciprofloxa-cin) have limited activity against GAS and should not be used to treat GAS pharyngitis <b>(Class III, LOE B)</b>.59 Newer fluoro-quinolones (eg, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) are active in vitro against GAS but are expensive and have an unnecessarily broad spectrum of activity, and therefore, they are not recommended for routine treatment of GAS pharyngitis <b>(Class III, LOE B)</b>.60\n</p><p><b>Other Treatment Recommendations\n</b></p><p><b><i>Follow-Up Throat Cultures\n</i></b></p><p>The majority of patients with GAS pharyngitis respond clinically to antimicrobial therapy, and GAS are eradicated from the pharynx.61 Posttreatment throat cultures 2 to 7 days after completion of therapy are indicated only in the relatively few patients who remain symptomatic, whose symptoms recur, or who have had rheumatic fever and are therefore at unusually high risk for recurrence <b>(Class I, LOE C)</b>.\n</p><p><b><i>Treatment Failures\n</i></b></p><p>Failure to eradicate GAS from the throat occurs more frequently after the administration of oral penicillin than after the administration of intramuscular benzathine penicillin G.62 Repeated courses of antibiotic therapy are rarely indicated in asymptomatic patients who continue to harbor GAS after appropriate therapy <b>(Class IIb, LOE C)</b>. Many patients in whom treatment fails are chronic carriers who have prolonged periods of GAS colonization.63 A second course of of penicillin with rifampin, are reasonable in the treatment of patients with GAS pharyngitis in whom initial penicillin treatment has failed <b>(Class IIa, LOE B)</b>.\n</p><p><b><i>Carriers\n</i></b></p><p>Chronic streptococcal carriers (defined as individuals with positive throat cultures for GAS without clinical findings or immunologic response to GAS antigens) usually do not need to be identified or treated with antibiotics.18 Streptococcal carriage may persist for many months, and a difficult diagnostic problem arises when symptomatic upper respiratory tract viral infections develop in carriers. Because it is impossible in that setting to distinguish carriers from infected individuals, a single course of appropriate antibiotic therapy should be administered to any patient with acute pharyngitis and evidence of GAS by a throat swab culture or an antigen detection test <b>(Class I, LOE C)</b>. Streptococcal carriers appear to be at little risk for development of rheumatic fever. In general, chronic carriers are thought not to be important in the spread of GAS to individuals who live and work around them.18\n</p><p><b><i>Non-GAS Pharyngitis\n</i></b></p><p>Both group C and group G  -hemolytic streptococci can cause acute pharyngitis with clinical features similar to those of GAS pharyngitis. Group C streptococci are a relatively common cause of acute pharyngitis among college students and among adults who go to an emergency department for treatment.64,65 Acute rheumatic fever has not been described as a complication of either group C or group G streptococcal pharyngitis; therefore, the primary reason to identify either group C or group G streptococcus as the cause of acute pharyngitis is to initiate antimicrobial therapy that may mitigate the clinical course of the infection. However, there is currently no convincing evidence from controlled studies of clinical response to antimicrobial therapy in patients with acute pharyngitis and either group C or group G streptococcus isolated from their pharynx.\n</p><p><b>Prevention of Recurrent Attacks of Rheumatic Fever (Secondary Prevention)\n</b></p><p><b>General Considerations\n</b></p><p>An individual with a previous attack of rheumatic fever in whom GAS pharyngitis develops is at high risk for a recurrent attack of rheumatic fever.

Continuous prophylaxis is recommended for patients with well-documented histories of rheumatic fever (including cases manifested solely by Sydenham chorea) and those with definite evidence of rheumatic heart disease <b>(Class I, LOE A)</b>. Such prophylaxis should be initiated as soon as acute rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease is diagnosed. A full therapeutic course of penicillin (as outlined in Table 2) first should be given to patients with acute rheumatic fever to eradicate residual GAS, even if a throat culture is negative at that time. Streptococcal infections that occur in family members of patients with current or previous rheumatic fever should be treated promptly <b>(Class I, LOE B)</b>.\n</p><p><b>Duration of Prophylaxis\n</b></p><p>Continuous antimicrobial prophylaxis provides the most effective protection from rheumatic fever recurrences. Risk of recurrence depends on several factors. Risk increases with multiple previous attacks, whereas the risk decreases as the interval since the most recent attack lengthens.4,6,66 In addition, the likelihood of acquiring a GAS upper respiratory tract infection is an important consideration. Individuals with increased exposure to streptococcal infections include children and adolescents, parents of young children, teachers, physicians, nurses and allied health personnel in contact with children, military recruits, and others living in crowded situations (eg, college dormitories). A higher risk of recurrences in economically disadvantaged populations has been demonstrated.39,67\n</p><p>Physicians must consider each individual situation when determining the appropriate duration of prophylaxis. In addition to the risk factors for recurrence described above, the presence of rheumatic heart disease also needs to be ease) is present or absent. Patients who have had rheumatic carditis, with or without valvular disease, are at a relatively high risk for recurrences of carditis and are likely to sustain increasingly severe cardiac involvement with each recurrence.5,6,68 Therefore, patients who have had rheumatic carditis should receive long-term antibiotic prophylaxis well into adulthood and perhaps for life <b>(Class I, LOE C)</b>. For patients with persistent valvular disease, the committee recommends prophylaxis for 10 years after the last episode of acute rheumatic fever or until 40 years of age (whichever is longer). After that time, the severity of the valvular disease and the potential for exposure to GAS should be discussed, and continued prophylaxis (potentially lifelong) should be considered for high-risk patients. Prophylaxis should continue even after valve surgery, including prosthetic valve replacement. For patients without persistent valvular disease, prophylaxis should continue for 10 years or until the patient is 21 years of age, whichever is longer <b>(Class I, LOE C)</b>.\n</p><p>Patients who have had rheumatic fever without rheumatic carditis are also at risk for cardiac involvement with recurrences, although the risk is lower. In general, prophylaxis should continue in these patients until the patient reaches 21 years of age or until 5 years has elapsed since the last rheumatic fever attack, whichever is longer <b>(Class I, LOE C)</b>. In all situations, the decision to discontinue prophylaxis or to reinstate it should be made after discussion with the patient of the potential risks and benefits and careful consideration of the epidemiological risk factors enumerated above.\n</p><p><b>Choice of Regimen for Prevention of Recurrent Rheumatic Fever\n</b></p><p><b><i>Intramuscular Benzathine Penicillin G (Bicillin L-A)\n</i></b></p><p>An injection of 1 200 000 U of this long-acting penicillin preparation every 4 weeks is the recommended regimen for secondary prevention in most circumstances in the United States <b>(Class I, LOE A</b>; Table 4<b>)</b>. In populations in which the incidence of rheumatic fever is particularly high, the administration of benzathine penicillin G every 3 weeks is justified and recommended, because serum drug levels may fall below a protective level before the fourth week after administration of this dose of penicillin <b>(Class I,\n</b></p><p>Rheumatic fever with carditis and residual heart disease (persistent valvular disease*)\n</p><p>10 years or until 40 years of age (whichever is longer), sometimes lifelong prophylaxis (see text)\n</p><p>IC\n</p><p>Rheumatic fever with carditis but no residual heart disease (no valvular disease*)\n</p><p>10 years or until 21 years of age (whichever is longer)\n</p><p>IC\n</p><p>Rheumatic fever without carditis\n</p><p>5 years or until 21 years of age (whichever is longer)\n</p><p>IC\n</p><p>Rating indicates classification of recommendation and LOE (eg, IC indicates class I, LOE C).\n</p><p>*Clinical or echocardiographic evidence.\n</p><p><b>Table 4.

Long-acting penicillin is of particular value in patients with a high risk of rheumatic fever recurrence, especially those with rheumatic heart disease, in whom the consequences of recurrence may be serious. The advantages of benzathine penicillin G must be weighed against the inconvenience to the patient and the pain of injection, which causes some individuals to discontinue prophylaxis. Although there has been concern about the risk of serious allergic reactions in patients receiving long-term intramuscular benzathine penicillin G prophylaxis for rheumatic fever, a large, international, prospective study determined that life-threatening allergic reactions are rare in these patients.71 It has been demonstrated that the long-term benefits of such prophylaxis far outweigh the risk of serious allergic reactions.\n</p><p><b><i>Oral Agents\n</i></b></p><p>Successful oral prophylaxis depends primarily on patient adherence to prescribed regimens (compliance). Patients need careful and repeated instructions about the importance of continuing prophylaxis. Most failures of prophylaxis occur in nonadherent patients. Even with optimal patient adherence, the risk of recurrence is higher in individuals receiving oral prophylaxis than in those receiving intramuscular benzathine penicillin G.62 Oral agents are more appropriate for patients at lower risk for rheumatic fever recurrence. Accordingly, some physicians may consider switching patients to oral prophylaxis when they have reached late adolescence or young adulthood and have remained free of rheumatic attacks for at least 5 years <b>(Class IIb, LOE C)</b>.\n</p><p><b><i>Penicillin V\n</i></b></p><p>The recommended oral agent is penicillin V <b>(Class I, LOE B)</b>. The dosage for children and adults is 250 mg twice daily (Table 4). There are no published data about the use of other penicillins, macrolides, azalides, or cephalosporins for the secondary prevention of rheumatic fever.\n</p><p><b><i>Sulfadiazine\n</i></b></p><p>For patients allergic to penicillin, sulfadiazine is recommended <b>(Class I, LOE B)</b>. Although sulfonamides are not effective in the eradication of GAS, they do prevent infection. The recommended dose of sulfadiazine is 0.5 g once per day for patients weighing 27 kg (60 lb) or less and 1 g once per day for patients weighing  27 kg. Sulfadiazine and sulfisox-azole appear to be equivalent; therefore, the use of sulfisox-azole is acceptable on the basis of extrapolation from data demonstrating that sulfadiazine has proven effectiveness in secondary prophylaxis <b>(Class IIa, LOE C)</b>. The recommended dose of sulfisoxazole is the same as that for sulfadia-\n</p><p>zine. Sulfonamide prophylaxis is contraindicated in late pregnancy because of transplacental passage of the drugs and 3A, they should not be taken concurrently with inhibitors of cytochrome P-450 3A such as azole antifungal agents, HIV protease inhibitors, and some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants.53,54\n</p><p><b>Bacterial Endocarditis Prophylaxis\n</b></p><p>The AHA has recently published updated recommendations regarding the use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infective endocarditis.72 Because of the lack of published evidence indicating that the principle of prophylaxis is definitively valid as it has been applied to infective endocarditis prevention, the value of infective endocarditis prophylaxis has been called into question by the AHA, as well as by other international scientific bodies.73 However, the AHA and others continue to recognize that certain conditions, such as patients with prosthetic valves, those with previous endocarditis, cardiac transplant recipients who develop cardiac valvulopathy, and specific forms of congenital heart disease, are associated with the highest risk of adverse outcome from endocarditis, and given that documented high risk, prophylaxis remains indicated. Notably, the current AHA recommendations no longer suggest prophylaxis for patients with rheumatic heart disease. However, the maintenance of optimal oral health care remains an important component of an overall health-care program. For the relatively few patients with rheumatic heart disease in whom infective endocarditis prophylaxis remains recommended, such as those with prosthetic valves or prosthetic material used in valve repair, the current AHA recommendations should be followed.72 These recommendations advise the use of an agent other than a penicillin to prevent infective endocarditis in those receiving penicillin prophylaxis for rheumatic fever, because oral  -hemolytic streptococci are likely to have developed resistance to penicillin.\n</p><p><b>Poststreptococcal Reactive Arthritis\n</b></p><p>The term \"poststreptococcal reactive arthritis\" (PSRA) was first used in 1959 to describe an entity in patients who had arthritis after an episode of GAS pharyngitis but lacked other major criteria of acute rheumatic fever.74 Patients with PSRA and with acute rheumatic fever have arthritis that occurs after a symptom-free interval after an episode of GAS pharyngitis. However, the arthritis of rheumatic fever occurs 14 to 21 days after an episode of GAS pharyngitis and responds rapidly to acetylsalicylic acid, whereas PSRA occurs  10 days after the GAS pharyngitis and does not respond readily to acetylsalicylic acid. In addition, the arthritis of rheumatic fever is migratory and transient and usually involves only the large joints,\n</p><p> by guest on N\n</p><p>ovem\n</p><p>ber 14, 2017\n</p><p>http://circ.ahajournals.org/ D ow\n</p><p>nloaded from\ncarditis. Some experts recommend that these patients receive secondary prophylaxis for up to 1 year after the onset of their symptoms, but its effectiveness is not well established <b>(Class IIb, LOE C)</b>. If clinical evidence of carditis is not observed, the prophylaxis can be discontinued. If valvular disease is detected, the patient should be classified as having had acute rheumatic fever and should continue to receive secondary prophylaxis <b>(Class I, LOE C)</b>. The term PSRA subsequently has been used inconsistently in the literature to refer to a variety of constellations of signs and symptoms. Most of the information about PSRA is based on case reports or small series.76 Although criteria have been proposed to define a homogeneous syndrome,75 the case reports of PSRA have been quite heterogeneous. It is still not clear whether this entity represents a distinct syndrome or is a manifestation of acute rheumatic fever.76 Investigations are required to determine whether there is a true association between reactive arthritis after GAS pharyngitis and acute rheumatic fever and whether antimicrobial prophylaxis is needed after PSRA.\n</p><p><b>Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated With Streptococcal Infections\n</b></p><p>In 1998, investigators proposed the hypothesis that childhood obsessive-compulsive disorder and/or tics may arise infections).77 They proposed that a subset of patients with obsessive-compulsive and tic disorders produce autoimmune responses that cross-react with brain tissue in response to a GAS infection, similar to the autoimmune response believed to be responsible for the manifestations of Sydenham chorea (a major manifestation of acute rheumatic fever). If this were correct, secondary prophylaxis that prevents recurrences of Sydenham chorea might also be effective in preventing recurrences of obsessive-compulsive and tic disorders in these patients. Because of the proposed autoimmune mechanism, it has also been suggested that these patients may benefit from immunoregulatory therapy such as plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin infusions.\n</p><p>The PANDAS hypothesis has stimulated considerable research, as well as considerable controversy. The current state of knowledge dictates that the concept of PANDAS should be considered only as a yet-unproven hypothesis.78,79 Until carefully designed and well-controlled studies have established a causal relationship between PANDAS and GAS infections, the committee does not recommend routine laboratory testing for GAS to diagnose, long-term antistreptococ-cal prophylaxis to prevent, or immunoregulatory therapy (eg, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasma exchange) to treat exacerbations of this disorder <b>(Class III, LOE B)</b>.\n</p><p><b>Disclosures\n</b></p><p><b>Writing Group Disclosures\n</b></p><p>Writing Group\n</p><p>Member Employment Research Grant\n</p><p>Other Research Support\n</p><p>Speakers' Bureau/Honoraria\n</p><p>Expert Witness\n</p><p>Ownership Interest\n</p><p>Consultant/Advisory Board Other\n</p><p>Michael A.

Taubert, PhD, FAHA\n\nAbstract-Primary prevention of acute rheumatic fever is accomplished by proper identification and adequate antibiotic treatment of group A -hemolytic streptococcal (GAS) tonsillopharyngitis. Diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis is best accomplished by combining clinical judgment with diagnostic test results, the criterion standard of which is the throat culture. Penicillin (either oral penicillin V or injectable benzathine penicillin) is the treatment of choice, because it is cost-effective, has a narrow spectrum of activity, and has long-standing proven efficacy, and GAS resistant to penicillin have not been documented. For penicillin-allergic individuals, acceptable alternatives include a narrow-spectrum oral cephalosporin, oral clindamycin, or various oral macrolides or azalides. The individual who has had an attack of rheumatic fever is at very high risk of developing recurrences after subsequent GAS pharyngitis and needs continuous antimicrobial prophylaxis to prevent such recurrences (secondary prevention). The recommended duration of prophylaxis depends on the number of previous attacks, the time elapsed since the last attack, the risk of exposure to GAS infections, the age of the patient, and the presence or absence of cardiac involvement. Penicillin is again the agent of choice for secondary prophylaxis, but sulfadiazine or a macrolide or azalide are acceptable alternatives in penicillin-allergic individuals. This report updates the 1995 statement by the American Heart Association Rheumatic Fever, Endocarditis, and Kawasaki Disease Committee. It includes new recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of GAS pharyngitis, as well as for the secondary prevention of rheumatic fever, and classifies the strength of the recommendations and level of evidence supporting them.

Specifically, all members of the writing group are required to complete and submit a Disclosure Questionnaire showing all such relationships that might be perceived as real or potential conflicts of interest.\n\nAHA Scientific Statement\n\nby guest on N\n\novem\n\nber 14, 2017\n\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/ D ow\n\nnloaded from bial prophylaxis for years to prevent such recurrences (secondary prevention).2-6\n\nIn developing areas of the world, acute rheumatic feer and rheumatic heart disease are estimated to affect nearly 20 million people and are the leading causes of cardiovascular death during the first 5 decades of life.7 In contrast, the incidence of acute rheumatic fever has decreased dramatically in most developed countries.8 In certain areas of the United States, a few localized outbreaks in civilian and military populations were reported in the 1980s.8,9 This reappearance of acute rheumatic fever serves as a reminder of the importance of continued attention to prevention of rheumatic fever in this and other developed countries; however, currently, the overall incidence of acute rheumatic fever remains very low in most areas of the United States.10,11 The recommendations in the present statement are primarily based on this assumption. Physicians practicing in areas outside the United States with a higher incidence of acute rheumatic fever or in areas of the United States experiencing an outbreak of acute rheumatic fever need to take this into consideration.\n\nThe writing group was charged with the task of performing an assessment of the evidence and assigning a classification of recommendations and a level of evidence (LOE) to each recommendation. The American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association (AHA) classification system was used as follows:\n\nClassification of Recommendations:\n\nClass I: Conditions for which there is evidence and/or general agreement that a given procedure or treatment is beneficial, useful, and effective.\n\nClass II: Conditions for which there is conflicting evidence and/or a divergence of opinion about the usefulness/ efficacy of a procedure or treatment.\n\nClass IIa: Weight of evidence/opinion is in favor of usefulness/efficacy.\n\nClass IIb: Usefulness/efficacy is less well established by evidence/opinion.\n\nClass III: Conditions for which there is evidence and/or general agreement that a procedure/treatment is not useful/ effective and in some cases may be harmful.\n\nLevel of Evidence:\n\nLevel of Evidence A: Data derived from multiple randomized clinical trials or meta-analyses.\n\nLevel of Evidence B: Data derived from a single randomized trial or nonrandomized studies.\n\nLevel of Evidence C: Only consensus opinion of experts, cases studies, or standard of care. least one third of episodes of acute rheumatic fever result from inapparent streptococcal infections.14 In addition, some symptomatic patients do not seek medical care. In these instances, rheumatic fever is not preventable.\n\nDiagnosis of Streptococcal Infections\n\nPrevention of initial episodes of acute rheumatic fever requires accurate recognition and proper antibiotic treatment of GAS pharyngitis. Streptococcal skin infections (impetigo or pyoderma) have not been proven to lead to acute rheumatic fever and are not discussed here. Acute pharyngitis is caused considerably more often by viruses than by bacteria. Viruses that commonly cause pharyngitis include influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, Epstein-Barr virus, enteroviruses, and herpesviruses. Other causes of acute pharyngitis include groups C and G streptococci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Arcanobacterium hemo-lyticum, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n\nGAS pharyngitis is primarily a disease of children 5 to 15 years of age, and in temperate climates, it usually occurs in the winter and early spring. GAS is an uncommon cause of pharyngitis in preschool children, but outbreaks in child care settings have been reported.15,16 However, rheumatic fever is rare in children younger than 3 years of age in the United States. Initial attacks of rheumatic fever are also rare in adults, but recurrences are well documented.\n\nClinical findings suggestive of GAS as the cause of an episode of acute pharyngitis (Table 1) include sore throat (generally of sudden onset), pain on swallowing, fever of varying degree (usually from 101°F to 104°F), and headache; abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting may also occur, especially in children. Additional clinical findings include tonsillopharyngeal erythema with or without exudates, anterior cervical lymphadenitis, soft palate petechiae, beefy red swollen uvula, and a scarlatiniform rash. None of these clinical manifestations individually is specific enough to diagnose GAS pharyngitis, and these clinical signs and symptoms can occur with other upper respiratory tract infections. These clinical findings are noted primarily in children older than 3 years of age and in adults. Clinical findings in younger children can be different and less specific. For example, infants with GAS upper respiratory tract infections may present with excoriated nares or purulent nasal discharge. A history of close contact with a well-documented case of GAS pharyngitis may be helpful in making the diagnosis, as is an awareness of a high prevalence of GAS infections in the community. Clinical findings highly suggestive of a viral cause of an episode of acute pharyngitis include coryza, hoarseness, cough, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, and a\n\nby guest on N\n\novem\n\nber 14, 2017\n\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/ D ow\n\nnloaded from\n\n(Class I, LOE B).17 Neither the blood agar plate culture nor the RADT can accurately differentiate individuals with bona fide GAS pharyngitis from GAS carriers (defined as individuals with positive throat cultures for GAS without an immunologic response to GAS) with intercurrent viral pharyngitis. However, they do facilitate the withholding of antibiotics from the great majority of patients with sore throats, whose cultures or RADTs are negative, and this is extremely important. Pharyngeal carriage of GAS is a common finding, particularly in school-age children. In the winter and early spring, as many as 15% of school-age children may be asymptomatic GAS carriers.18\n\nWhen deciding whether to perform a microbiological test for a patient with acute pharyngitis, the clinical and epidemiological findings in Table 1 need to be considered (Class I, LOE B). If these findings are suggestive of GAS pharyngitis, then a throat culture or RADT should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. It is easier to exclude the diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis accurately than it is to establish the diagnosis accurately. Therefore, for patients with acute pharyngitis and clinical and epidemiological findings suggestive of a viral origin, the pretest probability initial attack of acute rheumatic fever is extremely low in adults, even those with an undiagnosed and untreated episode of GAS pharyngitis. Therefore, the use of a clinical algorithm without microbiological confirmation has been recommended recently by some authors as an acceptable strategy for diagnosing GAS pharyngitis in adults but not children.19 However, use of this approach could result in the receipt of inappropriate antimicrobial therapy by an unacceptably large number of adults with nonstreptococcal pharyngitis and is not recommended (Class III, LOE B).17,20,21\n\nThroat Culture\n\nThroat culture is the conventional method for establishing the diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis and is the criterion standard. In an untreated patient with GAS pharyngitis, a properly obtained (by vigorous swabbing of both tonsils and posterior pharynx) throat culture is almost always positive; however, a positive throat culture may reflect chronic colonization by GAS, and the acute illness may be caused by another agent. Quantitation of GAS from the throat swab culture cannot be used to differentiate carriage from infection, because sparse growth may be associated with true infection. A negative throat culture permits the physician to withhold antibiotic therapy from the large majority of patients with sore throats.\n\nAntigen Detection Tests\n\nMany GAS antigen detection tests are available commercially. These tests vary in method. Most of these tests have a high degree of specificity, but their sensitivity in clinical practice can be unacceptably low. Therefore, treatment is indicated for the patient with acute pharyngitis who has a positive RADT (Class I, LOE B). As with the throat culture, a positive RADT may reflect chronic colonization by GAS, and the acute illness may be caused by another agent. With most RADTs, a negative test does not exclude the presence of GAS, and a throat culture should be performed (Class I, LOE B).17,22 Newer tests have been developed that may be more sensitive than other RADTs and perhaps even as sensitive as blood agar plate cultures.23,24 However, the definitive studies to determine whether some RADTs are significantly more sensitive than others and whether any of the RADTs are sensitive enough to be used routinely in children without throat culture confirmation of negative test results have not been performed. Some experts believe that physicians who use an RADT without culture backup in children and adolescents\n\nPain on swallowing Fever\n\nScarlet fever rash Headache\n\nNausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain Tonsillopharyngeal erythema Tonsillopharyngeal exudates\n\nSoft palate petechiae (\"doughnut\" lesions)\n\nBeefy, red, swollen uvula Tender, enlarged anterior cervical nodes Patient 5 to 15 years of age\n\nPresentation in winter or early spring (in temperate climates) History of exposure\n\nFeatures suggestive of viral origin Conjunctivitis Coryza Hoarseness Cough Diarrhea Characteristic exanthems Characteristic enanthems\n\nby guest on N\n\novem\n\nber 14, 2017\n\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/ D ow\n\nnloaded from culture, is reasonable and an acceptable alternative to diagnosis on the basis of throat culture results (Class IIa, LOE C).19\n\nStreptococcal Antibody Tests\n\nAntistreptococcal antibody titers reflect past and not present immunologic events and therefore cannot be used to determine whether an individual with pharyngitis and GAS in the pharynx is truly infected or merely a streptococcal carrier. When present, elevated or rising antistreptococcal antibody titers provide reliable confirmation of a recent GAS infection and are of value in identifying a preceding GAS infection in a patient suspected of having rheumatic fever. The most commonly used and commercially available antibody assays are antistreptolysin O and antideoxyribonuclease B. These tests are valuable in patients who have possible nonsuppura-tive complications of GAS infections (acute rheumatic fever or acute glomerulonephritis). The antistreptolysin O test is usually obtained first, and if it is not elevated, an antideoxyri-bonuclease B test may be performed. Antistreptolysin O titers begin to rise approximately 1 week and peak 3 to 6 weeks after the infection. Antideoxyribonuclease B titers begin to rise 1 to 2 weeks and peak 6 to 8 weeks after the infection. Elevated titers for both tests may persist for several months after even uncomplicated GAS infections.\n\nIt is not uncommon for laboratory personnel and physicians to misinterpret streptococcal antibody titers because of a failure to lems when interpreting the results of streptococcal serological testing performed on their patients.\n\nA commercially available slide agglutination test for the detection of antibodies to several streptococcal antigens is the Streptozyme test (Wampole Laboratories, Stamford, Conn). This test is less well standardized and less reproducible than other antibody tests, and it should not be used as a test for evidence of a preceding GAS infection (Class III, LOE B).27,28\n\nRecommended Treatment Schedules\n\nPrevention of rheumatic fever requires adequate therapy for GAS pharyngitis. In selecting a regimen for the treatment of GAS pharyngitis, physicians should consider various factors, including bacteriologic and clinical efficacy, ease of adherence to the recommended regimen (frequency of daily administration, duration of therapy, and palatability), cost, spectrum of activity of the selected agent, and potential side effects. No regimen eradicates GAS from the pharynx in 100% of treated patients, even though 100% of GAS demonstrate in vitro susceptibility to all -lactam agents (penicillins and cephalosporins).\n\nIntramuscular benzathine penicillin G and oral penicillin V are the recommended antimicrobial drugs for the treatment of GAS, except in individuals with histories of penicillin allergy (Class I, LOE B; Table 2).

Even when started as long as 9 days after the onset of acute illness, penicillin effectively prevents primary attacks of rheumatic fever.31 Therefore, a 24- to 48-hour delay to process the throat culture before antibiotic therapy is started does not increase the risk of rheumatic fever. However, early diagnosis (eg, by rapid antigen test) and therapy may reduce the period of infectivity and morbidity, which would allow the patient to return to normal activity sooner. Patients are considered no longer contagious after 24 hours of antibiotic therapy.32\n\nOral Penicillins\n\nThe oral antibiotics of choice are penicillin V and amoxicillin (Table 2). Comparative clinical trials used penicillin V dosages of 40 mg/kg (not to exceed 750 mg for those weighing 27 kg) per 24 hours, given in 3 equally divided doses. Generally, 250 mg 2 times daily is recommended for most children (Class I, LOE B).33,34 Little information is available about comparable penicillin doses in adults. A dose of 500 mg 2 to 3 times daily is recommended for adolescents and adults (Class I, LOE B). All patients should continue to take penicillin regularly for an entire 10-day period, even though they likely will be asymptomatic after the first few days (Class I, LOE A). Penicillin V is preferred to penicillin G because it is more resistant to gastric acid. An oral, time-released formulation of amoxicillin (Moxatag; Middle-Brook Pharmaceuticals, Westlake, Tex) was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for once-daily therapy of GAS pharyngitis in those 12 years of age and older. In comparative clinical trials, once-daily amoxicillin (50 mg/kg, maximum 1000 mg) for 10 days has been shown to be effective for GAS pharyngitis (Class I, LOE B).35-38 This somewhat broader-spectrum agent has the advantage of once-daily dosing, which may enhance adherence, and is relatively inexpensive, and amoxicillin suspension is considerably more palatable than penicillin V suspension.\n\nIntramuscular Benzathine Penicillin G\n\nBenzathine penicillin G should be considered particularly for patients who are unlikely to complete a 10-day course of oral therapy and for patients with personal or family histories of rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease or environmental factors (such as crowded living conditions or low socioeconomic status) that place them at enhanced risk for rheumatic fever (Class IIa, LOE B).39-42 Benzathine penicillin G 300 000 U of procaine penicillin G (Bicillin C-R 900/300) is satisfactory therapy for most smaller children.43 The efficacy of this combination for heavier patients such as large teenagers or adults requires further study.\n\nAllergic reactions to penicillin are more common in adults than in children. Reactions occur in only a small percentage of patients, are more frequent after injection, and include urticaria and angioneurotic edema. A serum sickness-like reaction characterized by fever and joint pain may be mistaken for acute rheumatic fever. Anaphylaxis is rare, especially in children. A careful history regarding allergic reactions to penicillin should be obtained.\n\nOther Antimicrobial Agents\n\nOral Cephalosporins\n\nA 10-day course of a narrow-spectrum oral cephalosporin is recommended for most penicillin-allergic individuals (Class I, LOE B). Several reports indicate that a l0-day course with an oral cephalosporin is superior to 10 days of oral penicillin in eradicating GAS from the pharynx.44-47 Analysis of these data suggest that the difference in eradication is due mainly to a higher rate of eradication of carriers included unintentionally in these clinical trials. Narrow-spectrum cephalosporins such as cefadroxil or cephalexin are much preferred to broad-spectrum cephalosporins such as cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefixime, cefdinir, and cefpodoxime. Some penicillin-allergic persons (up to 10%) are also allergic to cephalosporins, and these agents should not be used in patients with immediate (anaphylactic-type) hypersensitivity to penicillin.48\n\nMost oral broad-spectrum cephalosporins are considerably more expensive than penicillin or amoxicillin, and the former agents are more likely to select for antibiotic-resistant flora. Other reports suggest that a 5-day course with selected oral broad-spectrum cephalosporins is comparable to a 10-day course of oral penicillin in eradicating GAS from the pharynx.49-52 Some of these regimens are not currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and further studies are warranted to expand and confirm these observations before these shorter-course regimens can be recommended.\n\nOral Clindamycin\n\nClindamycin resistance among GAS isolates in the United States is 1%, and this is a reasonable agent for treating penicillin-allergic patients (Class IIa, LOE B; Table 2).\n\nMacrolides\n\nThe use of an oral macrolide (erythromycin or clarithromy-cin) or azalide (azithromycin) is reasonable for patients allergic to penicillins (Class IIa, LOE B). Ten days of\n\nby guest on N\n\novem\n\nber 14, 2017\n\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/ D ow\n\nnloaded from substantially higher rates of gastrointestinal side effects than the other agents (Class IIb, LOE B). Strains of GAS resistant to these agents have been highly prevalent in some areas of the world, which has resulted in treatment failures.55 In recent years, macrolide resistance rates among pharyngeal isolates in most areas of the United States have been approximately 5% to 8%.56\n\nOther Considerations\n\nStudies suggesting that -lactamase-producing upper respiratory tract flora may interfere with penicillin in the treatment of GAS pharyngitis have not been confirmed.57 Antibiotic therapy directed against these organisms remains controversial and is not indicated in patients with acute pharyngitis (Class III, LOE B).\n\nCertain antimicrobials are not recommended for treatment of group A streptococcal upper respiratory tract infections. Tetracyclines should not be used because of the high prevalence of resistant strains (Class III, LOE B). Sulfonamides and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole do not eradicate GAS in patients with pharyngitis and should not be used to treat active infections (Class III, LOE B).58 Older fluoroquinolones (eg, ciprofloxa-cin) have limited activity against GAS and should not be used to treat GAS pharyngitis (Class III, LOE B).59 Newer fluoro-quinolones (eg, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin) are active in vitro against GAS but are expensive and have an unnecessarily broad spectrum of activity, and therefore, they are not recommended for routine treatment of GAS pharyngitis (Class III, LOE B).60\n\nOther Treatment Recommendations\n\nFollow-Up Throat Cultures\n\nThe majority of patients with GAS pharyngitis respond clinically to antimicrobial therapy, and GAS are eradicated from the pharynx.61 Posttreatment throat cultures 2 to 7 days after completion of therapy are indicated only in the relatively few patients who remain symptomatic, whose symptoms recur, or who have had rheumatic fever and are therefore at unusually high risk for recurrence (Class I, LOE C).\n\nTreatment Failures\n\nFailure to eradicate GAS from the throat occurs more frequently after the administration of oral penicillin than after the administration of intramuscular benzathine penicillin G.62 Repeated courses of antibiotic therapy are rarely indicated in asymptomatic patients who continue to harbor GAS after appropriate therapy (Class IIb, LOE C). Many patients in whom treatment fails are chronic carriers who have prolonged periods of GAS colonization.63 A second course of of penicillin with rifampin, are reasonable in the treatment of patients with GAS pharyngitis in whom initial penicillin treatment has failed (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\nCarriers\n\nChronic streptococcal carriers (defined as individuals with positive throat cultures for GAS without clinical findings or immunologic response to GAS antigens) usually do not need to be identified or treated with antibiotics.18 Streptococcal carriage may persist for many months, and a difficult diagnostic problem arises when symptomatic upper respiratory tract viral infections develop in carriers. Because it is impossible in that setting to distinguish carriers from infected individuals, a single course of appropriate antibiotic therapy should be administered to any patient with acute pharyngitis and evidence of GAS by a throat swab culture or an antigen detection test (Class I, LOE C). Streptococcal carriers appear to be at little risk for development of rheumatic fever. In general, chronic carriers are thought not to be important in the spread of GAS to individuals who live and work around them.18\n\nNon-GAS Pharyngitis\n\nBoth group C and group G -hemolytic streptococci can cause acute pharyngitis with clinical features similar to those of GAS pharyngitis. Group C streptococci are a relatively common cause of acute pharyngitis among college students and among adults who go to an emergency department for treatment.64,65 Acute rheumatic fever has not been described as a complication of either group C or group G streptococcal pharyngitis; therefore, the primary reason to identify either group C or group G streptococcus as the cause of acute pharyngitis is to initiate antimicrobial therapy that may mitigate the clinical course of the infection. However, there is currently no convincing evidence from controlled studies of clinical response to antimicrobial therapy in patients with acute pharyngitis and either group C or group G streptococcus isolated from their pharynx.\n\nPrevention of Recurrent Attacks of Rheumatic Fever (Secondary Prevention)\n\nGeneral Considerations\n\nAn individual with a previous attack of rheumatic fever in whom GAS pharyngitis develops is at high risk for a recurrent attack of rheumatic fever. A recurrent attack can be associated with worsening of the severity of rheumatic heart disease that developed after a first attack, or less frequently with the new onset of rheumatic heart disease in individuals who did not develop cardiac manifestations during the first\n\nby guest on N\n\novem\n\nber 14, 2017\n\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/ D ow\n\nnloaded from and treatment of acute episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis. Continuous prophylaxis is recommended for patients with well-documented histories of rheumatic fever (including cases manifested solely by Sydenham chorea) and those with definite evidence of rheumatic heart disease (Class I, LOE A). Such prophylaxis should be initiated as soon as acute rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease is diagnosed. A full therapeutic course of penicillin (as outlined in Table 2) first should be given to patients with acute rheumatic fever to eradicate residual GAS, even if a throat culture is negative at that time. Streptococcal infections that occur in family members of patients with current or previous rheumatic fever should be treated promptly (Class I, LOE B).\n\nDuration of Prophylaxis\n\nContinuous antimicrobial prophylaxis provides the most effective protection from rheumatic fever recurrences. Risk of recurrence depends on several factors. Risk increases with multiple previous attacks, whereas the risk decreases as the interval since the most recent attack lengthens.4,6,66 In addition, the likelihood of acquiring a GAS upper respiratory tract infection is an important consideration. Individuals with increased exposure to streptococcal infections include children and adolescents, parents of young children, teachers, physicians, nurses and allied health personnel in contact with children, military recruits, and others living in crowded situations (eg, college dormitories). A higher risk of recurrences in economically disadvantaged populations has been demonstrated.39,67\n\nPhysicians must consider each individual situation when determining the appropriate duration of prophylaxis. In addition to the risk factors for recurrence described above, the presence of rheumatic heart disease also needs to be ease) is present or absent. Patients who have had rheumatic carditis, with or without valvular disease, are at a relatively high risk for recurrences of carditis and are likely to sustain increasingly severe cardiac involvement with each recurrence.5,6,68 Therefore, patients who have had rheumatic carditis should receive long-term antibiotic prophylaxis well into adulthood and perhaps for life (Class I, LOE C). For patients with persistent valvular disease, the committee recommends prophylaxis for 10 years after the last episode of acute rheumatic fever or until 40 years of age (whichever is longer). After that time, the severity of the valvular disease and the potential for exposure to GAS should be discussed, and continued prophylaxis (potentially lifelong) should be considered for high-risk patients. Prophylaxis should continue even after valve surgery, including prosthetic valve replacement. For patients without persistent valvular disease, prophylaxis should continue for 10 years or until the patient is 21 years of age, whichever is longer (Class I, LOE C).\n\nPatients who have had rheumatic fever without rheumatic carditis are also at risk for cardiac involvement with recurrences, although the risk is lower. In general, prophylaxis should continue in these patients until the patient reaches 21 years of age or until 5 years has elapsed since the last rheumatic fever attack, whichever is longer (Class I, LOE C). In all situations, the decision to discontinue prophylaxis or to reinstate it should be made after discussion with the patient of the potential risks and benefits and careful consideration of the epidemiological risk factors enumerated above.\n\nChoice of Regimen for Prevention of Recurrent Rheumatic Fever\n\nIntramuscular Benzathine Penicillin G (Bicillin L-A)\n\nAn injection of 1 200 000 U of this long-acting penicillin preparation every 4 weeks is the recommended regimen for secondary prevention in most circumstances in the United States (Class I, LOE A; Table 4). In populations in which the incidence of rheumatic fever is particularly high, the administration of benzathine penicillin G every 3 weeks is justified and recommended, because serum drug levels may fall below a protective level before the fourth week after administration of this dose of penicillin (Class I,\n\nRheumatic fever with carditis and residual heart disease (persistent valvular disease*)\n\n10 years or until 40 years of age (whichever is longer), sometimes lifelong prophylaxis (see text)\n\nIC\n\nRheumatic fever with carditis but no residual heart disease (no valvular disease*)\n\n10 years or until 21 years of age (whichever is longer)\n\nIC\n\nRheumatic fever without carditis\n\n5 years or until 21 years of age (whichever is longer)\n\nIC\n\nRating indicates classification of recommendation and LOE (eg, IC indicates class I, LOE C).\n\n*Clinical or echocardiographic evidence.\n\nTable 4.

Long-acting penicillin is of particular value in patients with a high risk of rheumatic fever recurrence, especially those with rheumatic heart disease, in whom the consequences of recurrence may be serious. The advantages of benzathine penicillin G must be weighed against the inconvenience to the patient and the pain of injection, which causes some individuals to discontinue prophylaxis. Although there has been concern about the risk of serious allergic reactions in patients receiving long-term intramuscular benzathine penicillin G prophylaxis for rheumatic fever, a large, international, prospective study determined that life-threatening allergic reactions are rare in these patients.71 It has been demonstrated that the long-term benefits of such prophylaxis far outweigh the risk of serious allergic reactions.\n\nOral Agents\n\nSuccessful oral prophylaxis depends primarily on patient adherence to prescribed regimens (compliance). Patients need careful and repeated instructions about the importance of continuing prophylaxis. Most failures of prophylaxis occur in nonadherent patients. Even with optimal patient adherence, the risk of recurrence is higher in individuals receiving oral prophylaxis than in those receiving intramuscular benzathine penicillin G.62 Oral agents are more appropriate for patients at lower risk for rheumatic fever recurrence. Accordingly, some physicians may consider switching patients to oral prophylaxis when they have reached late adolescence or young adulthood and have remained free of rheumatic attacks for at least 5 years (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\nPenicillin V\n\nThe recommended oral agent is penicillin V (Class I, LOE B). The dosage for children and adults is 250 mg twice daily (Table 4). There are no published data about the use of other penicillins, macrolides, azalides, or cephalosporins for the secondary prevention of rheumatic fever.\n\nSulfadiazine\n\nFor patients allergic to penicillin, sulfadiazine is recommended (Class I, LOE B). Although sulfonamides are not effective in the eradication of GAS, they do prevent infection. The recommended dose of sulfadiazine is 0.5 g once per day for patients weighing 27 kg (60 lb) or less and 1 g once per day for patients weighing 27 kg. Sulfadiazine and sulfisox-azole appear to be equivalent; therefore, the use of sulfisox-azole is acceptable on the basis of extrapolation from data demonstrating that sulfadiazine has proven effectiveness in secondary prophylaxis (Class IIa, LOE C). The recommended dose of sulfisoxazole is the same as that for sulfadia-\n\nzine. Sulfonamide prophylaxis is contraindicated in late pregnancy because of transplacental passage of the drugs and 3A, they should not be taken concurrently with inhibitors of cytochrome P-450 3A such as azole antifungal agents, HIV protease inhibitors, and some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants.53,54\n\nBacterial Endocarditis Prophylaxis\n\nThe AHA has recently published updated recommendations regarding the use of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent infective endocarditis.72 Because of the lack of published evidence indicating that the principle of prophylaxis is definitively valid as it has been applied to infective endocarditis prevention, the value of infective endocarditis prophylaxis has been called into question by the AHA, as well as by other international scientific bodies.73 However, the AHA and others continue to recognize that certain conditions, such as patients with prosthetic valves, those with previous endocarditis, cardiac transplant recipients who develop cardiac valvulopathy, and specific forms of congenital heart disease, are associated with the highest risk of adverse outcome from endocarditis, and given that documented high risk, prophylaxis remains indicated. Notably, the current AHA recommendations no longer suggest prophylaxis for patients with rheumatic heart disease. However, the maintenance of optimal oral health care remains an important component of an overall health-care program. For the relatively few patients with rheumatic heart disease in whom infective endocarditis prophylaxis remains recommended, such as those with prosthetic valves or prosthetic material used in valve repair, the current AHA recommendations should be followed.72 These recommendations advise the use of an agent other than a penicillin to prevent infective endocarditis in those receiving penicillin prophylaxis for rheumatic fever, because oral -hemolytic streptococci are likely to have developed resistance to penicillin.\n\nPoststreptococcal Reactive Arthritis\n\nThe term \"poststreptococcal reactive arthritis\" (PSRA) was first used in 1959 to describe an entity in patients who had arthritis after an episode of GAS pharyngitis but lacked other major criteria of acute rheumatic fever.74 Patients with PSRA and with acute rheumatic fever have arthritis that occurs after a symptom-free interval after an episode of GAS pharyngitis. However, the arthritis of rheumatic fever occurs 14 to 21 days after an episode of GAS pharyngitis and responds rapidly to acetylsalicylic acid, whereas PSRA occurs 10 days after the GAS pharyngitis and does not respond readily to acetylsalicylic acid. In addition, the arthritis of rheumatic fever is migratory and transient and usually involves only the large joints,\n\nby guest on N\n\novem\n\nber 14, 2017\n\nhttp://circ.ahajournals.org/ D ow\n\nnloaded from carditis. Some experts recommend that these patients receive secondary prophylaxis for up to 1 year after the onset of their symptoms, but its effectiveness is not well established (Class IIb, LOE C). If clinical evidence of carditis is not observed, the prophylaxis can be discontinued. If valvular disease is detected, the patient should be classified as having had acute rheumatic fever and should continue to receive secondary prophylaxis (Class I, LOE C). The term PSRA subsequently has been used inconsistently in the literature to refer to a variety of constellations of signs and symptoms. Most of the information about PSRA is based on case reports or small series.76 Although criteria have been proposed to define a homogeneous syndrome,75 the case reports of PSRA have been quite heterogeneous. It is still not clear whether this entity represents a distinct syndrome or is a manifestation of acute rheumatic fever.76 Investigations are required to determine whether there is a true association between reactive arthritis after GAS pharyngitis and acute rheumatic fever and whether antimicrobial prophylaxis is needed after PSRA.\n\nPediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated With Streptococcal Infections\n\nIn 1998, investigators proposed the hypothesis that childhood obsessive-compulsive disorder and/or tics may arise infections).77 They proposed that a subset of patients with obsessive-compulsive and tic disorders produce autoimmune responses that cross-react with brain tissue in response to a GAS infection, similar to the autoimmune response believed to be responsible for the manifestations of Sydenham chorea (a major manifestation of acute rheumatic fever). If this were correct, secondary prophylaxis that prevents recurrences of Sydenham chorea might also be effective in preventing recurrences of obsessive-compulsive and tic disorders in these patients. Because of the proposed autoimmune mechanism, it has also been suggested that these patients may benefit from immunoregulatory therapy such as plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin infusions.\n\nThe PANDAS hypothesis has stimulated considerable research, as well as considerable controversy. The current state of knowledge dictates that the concept of PANDAS should be considered only as a yet-unproven hypothesis.78,79 Until carefully designed and well-controlled studies have established a causal relationship between PANDAS and GAS infections, the committee does not recommend routine laboratory testing for GAS to diagnose, long-term antistreptococ-cal prophylaxis to prevent, or immunoregulatory therapy (eg, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasma exchange) to treat exacerbations of this disorder (Class III, LOE B).\n\nDisclosures\n\nWriting Group Disclosures\n\nWriting Group\n\nMember Employment Research Grant\n\nOther Research Support\n\nSpeakers' Bureau/Honoraria\n\nExpert Witness\n\nOwnership Interest\n\nConsultant/Advisory Board Other\n\nMichael A.

For further details, please refer to the individual relevant sections of the GINA Guidelines, which are available online (http://<a href=\"http://www.ginasthma.org\">www.\n</a><a href=\"http://www.ginasthma.org\">ginasthma.org</a>).\n</p><p><b>Definition and diagnosis\n</b></p><p><i>Definition\n</i></p><p>Asthma is a heterogeneous,multifactorial disease with variable andmostly reversible respiratory pathway obstruction based on a chronic bronchial inflammatory reaction. The symptoms (cough, rhonchus, wheezing, chest tightness, or shortness of breath) are variable and correlated with expiratory flow limitation. Although bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) is often present, the current GINA Guidelines no longer include it as a necessary or sufficient criterion for diagnosis.\n</p><p><i>Phenotypes\n</i></p><p>Owing to the heterogeneity of the disease, a number of different phenotypes can be described. Distinguishing between them can be particularly relevant to the therapy in severe cases:\n</p><p>● Allergic asthma\n</p><p>● Nonallergic asthma\n</p><p>● Pediatric asthma/recurrent obstructive bronchitis\n</p><p>● Late-onset asthma\n</p><p>● Asthma with fixed airflow obstruction\n</p><p>● Obesity asthma\n</p><p>● Occupational asthma\n</p><p>● Asthma in the elderly\n</p><p>● Severe asthma\n</p><p>Classifications by other professional associations (<i>ERS/ATS</i>, European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society) tend to focus more on a combination of clinical and pathophysiological aspects (e. g., eosinophilic/neutrophilic asthma, severe allergic asthma etc.).\n</p><p><i>Initial diagnosis\n</i></p><p>Diagnostic criteria and supplementary examinations Asthma may be suspected if the patient has a positive medical history of recurrent dry coughing, especially at night, rhonchus, wheezing, chest tightness, or shortness of breath.\n</p><p>Lung function testing can confirm the diagnosis if an airway obstruction is found reversible based on an FEV1 (Forced expiratory Volume in 1 second) increase of >12% and >200 ml (in adults) after administering 200-400 µg salbutamol. If there is clinical suspicion, but the lung function is normal, further bronchial challenge testing (e. g., with methacholine or indirect tests such as running exertion or inhalation of hype-rosmolar solutions) may be helpful, especially to determine bronchial hyperresponsiveness in adults. Furthermore, an FEV1 increase of +12% and >200 ml (in adults) after 4 weeks of anti-inflammatory therapy is considered diagnostic confirmation.\n</p><p>If an allergic trigger is suspected, an allergy diagnosis consisting of medical history, skin prick test, and/or definition of the specific IgE (Immunoglobu-line group E) should be performed. This should also include sensitizations that are not clinically relevant because they can provide prognostic information. Measuring fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) has not yet become an established practice in general asthma management and is not recommended in the current guidelines for a general therapy decision [6]. Nevertheless, in the view of this statement's authors, there are several indications in which an Fe-NO measurement makes sense, such as, for example: (1) as another component of asthma diagnosis in difficult cases (normal lung function, unclear symptoms), (2) to check on therapeutic adherence regarding inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), or (3) for the early detection of worsening asthma.\n</p><p>Differential diagnosis\n</p><p>The differential diagnosis for asthma in adults over 40 years of age should primarily consider chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), sinusitis, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The distinction between asthma and COPD can be difficult since symptoms may overlap, change, or exist in parallel (ACOS Asthma-COPD overlap syndrome). In younger patients, acute infections, congenital malformations (respiratory or heart), or foreign body aspirations may be more prominent (Table 1).\n</p><p><b>Follow-up\n</b></p><p><i>Asthma follow-up: symptoms and minimization of future risks\n</i></p><p>Asthma therapy aims to achieve maximum freedom from symptoms (nocturnal awakening, need for rescue medication, activity restrictions) and, thereby, maximum quality of life (Table 2). This can in most cases be achieved with consistent therapy. Therapeutic adherence is a problem because patients often do not suffer in spite of poor lung function and discontinue their therapy without asking their physician once they have experienced a quick response. Regular lung function controls are necessary, and a questionnaire such as the Asthma Control Test (ACT) can provide additional help for evaluating therapeutic efficacy in relation to symptom control.\n</p><p><b>Table 1 </b>Commondifferential diagnoses for asthma\n</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p>≤5 years </p></td><td><p>6-11 years </p></td><td><p>12-39 years </p></td><td><p>40+ years\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Recurrent viral infections </p></td><td><p>X\n</p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gastroesophageal reflux </p></td><td><p>X\n</p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Congenital malformations (tracheomalacia, vascular ring etc.) </p></td><td><p>X\n</p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Tuberculosis </p></td><td><p>X\n</p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Protracted bacterial bronchitis </p></td><td><p>X\n</p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Immunodeficiency </p></td><td><p>X\n</p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>PCD </p></td><td><p>X </p></td><td><p>X\n</p></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>BPD </p></td><td><p>X </p></td><td><p>X\n</p></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Foreign body aspiration </p></td><td><p>X </p></td><td><p>X </p></td><td><p>X\n</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Congenital heart defects </p></td><td><p>X </p></td><td><p>X </p></td><td><p>X\n</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Cystic fibrosis </p></td><td><p>X </p></td><td><p>X </p></td><td><p>X\n</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Chronic cough (upper respiratory tract) </p></td><td></td><td><p>X </p></td><td><p>X\n</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Bronchiectasis </p></td><td></td><td><p>X </p></td><td><p>X </p></td><td><p>X\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>VCD </p></td><td></td><td></td><td><p>X </p></td><td><p>X\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hyperventilation </p></td><td></td><td></td><td><p>X </p></td><td><p>X\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency </p></td><td></td><td></td><td><p>X </p></td><td><p>X\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>COPD </p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><p>X\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Left ventricular heart failure </p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><p>X\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Drug-related cough </p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><p>X\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Parenchymatous lung disease </p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><p>X\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Pulmonary embolism </p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><p>X\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Central airway obstruction </p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td><p>X\n</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"5\"><p>According to GINA update 2015, modified by the author team\n</p><p><i>PCD </i>primary ciliary dyskinesia, <i>BPD </i>bronchopulmonary dysplasia, <i>VCD </i>vocal cord dysfunction, <i>COPD </i>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><b>Table 2 </b>Asthmacontrol according toGINA for adults and children\n</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><p>Symptoms in the past 4 weeks\n</p></td><td colspan=\"2\"><p>Asthma symptom control\n</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p>Well-controlled\n</p></td><td><p>Partly controlled\n</p></td><td><p>Uncontrolled\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Daytime symptoms more than 2×/week (or 1×/weeka)\n</p></td><td colspan=\"3\"><p>No criterion applies\n</p><p>1-2 criteria apply\n</p><p>3-4 criteria apply\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Nocturnal awakening due to asthma (or coughinga) at any time\n</p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Reliever >2×/week (or >1×/weeka)\n</p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Any limitation of daily activity due to asthma\n</p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\"><p>aIn children ≤5 years\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Risk minimization includes smoking cessation, optimal protection from contaminants in the workplace, and specific immunotherapy.\n</p><p><i>Lung function control\n</i></p><p>A lung function test should be performed for diagnosis or prior to starting therapy. Follow-up should occur individually based on asthma severity/symptoms in intervals of 3-6 months. In addition to these recommendations of the GINA Guidelines, lung function testing, performed approximately 4-6 weeks after a change of therapy, has proven successful for controlling treatment efficacy. A minimally relevant change in the FEV1 is indicated as 10%.\n</p><p>Spirometry can generally be performed in children from about 6 years of age. Prior to that, diagnosis and follow-up have to rely on clinical parameters (see \"Preschoolers\"). It is important to note that spirometry results tend to be normal in many children with asthma and only show FEV1 restrictions during exacerbations.\n</p><p><i>Determination of asthma severity\n</i></p><p>The classification of asthma severity has fundamentally changed over the past years. Traditionally, the degree of severity (intermittent, mild, persistent etc.) was based on symptoms and the use of rescue inhalers and limited lung function. Strictly speaking, this classification only applied to untreated patients. Since the response to treatment is essential, GINA has recommended the concept of <i>asthma control </i>and <i>therapy steps </i>since 2006. Severity therefore is no longer a snapshot, but is established retrospectively after a treatment period of several months and can change over time. It results from the therapy step that is required to achieve asthma control (see Table 2):\n</p><p>● Mild asthma: therapy step 1 or 2\n</p><p>● Moderate asthma: therapy step 3\n</p><p>● Severe asthma: therapy step 4 or 5\n</p><p><b>Fig. 1 </b>Investigationof apatientwithpoor symptomcontrol or exacerbationsdespite therapy\n</p><p>In addition, the concept of severe asthma was clearly defined and differentiated from other terms such as uncontrolled or \"difficult-to-treat\" asthma. An exact definition can be found in a separate ERS/ATS guideline from 2014, to which GINA also makes reference [3]. \"Severe asthma\" is reserved for patients with actual therapy-resistant asthma after other factors such as poor inhalation technique and adherence to therapy, risk factors, continuous exposure to trigger factors (e. g., allergens, smoke) or co-morbidities have been excluded or optimally treated and the patient has received treatment from an asthma specialist for at least 3 months (see Fig. 1).\n</p><p>The World Health Organization term \"untreated severe asthma\" (common in countries with inadequate treatment options) also is no longer included in this definition of severe asthma.\n</p><p>It should also be noted that therapy steps 4 and 5 according to GINA or ERS/ATS have significant differences based on the defined limit values for high-dose ICS therapy (doses according to ERS/ATS are in part double compared with GINA). This has an indirect effect on the definition of severe asthma.\n</p><p><b>Therapy and management\n</b></p><p><i>Goals\n</i></p><p>General long-term objectives of asthma management include:\n</p><p>● Achieving symptom control and maintaining normal physical performance\n</p><p>● Minimizing the risk of exacerbations, fixed airway obstruction, and side effects of the therapy\n</p><p><b>Fig. 2 </b>Cycleof asthmacontrol\n</p><p>Furthermore, individual goals should be discussed with the patient and taken into account. A good partnership between the patient and the physician is essential for effective asthma management. Physicians should have good communication skills to encourage patients to take part in decisions and to express their needs and concerns. Patient self-management and knowledge about asthma should be promoted with training, as studies have documented positive effects on morbidity in adults and children.\n</p><p><i>Control-based asthma management\n</i></p><p>Modern asthma treatment (pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapy) is based on the concept of asthma control, which has been shown to improve the treatment success. This concept is based on a cycle of assess, adjust, and review (see Fig. 2).\n</p><p>Symptom control is usually associated with reduced asthma exacerbations. In the case of more severe forms, symptom control can occasionally not be paired with a reduced exacerbation rate. That makes it important to consider both factors of asthma control (symptoms and exacerbation risk).\n</p><p>As an alternative, other concepts such as therapy based on sputum or FeNO may be used in special cases, e. g., severe or difficult-to-treat asthma.\n</p><p><i>Drug therapy\n</i></p><p>Inhalation therapy is the application of choice for asthma. It leads to higher local concentrations, fewer systemic side effects, and, accordingly, to generally very good tolerance compared with systemic appli-\n</p><p><b>Table 3 </b>Medicationcategories for asthma treatment\n</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><p>Controller </p></td><td><p>Reliever </p></td><td><p>Add-on therapya\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)\n</p><p>ICS/LABA (long-acting beta-2-agonist) combination\n</p><p>Leukotriene receptor agonists (LTRA)\n</p><p>Long-acting anticholinergics (LAMA)\n</p><p>Methylxanthines (theophylline)\n</p><p>Chromones (practically no longer in use)\n</p></td><td><p>Short-acting beta-2-agonists (SABA) Short-acting anticholinergics (LAMA)\n</p></td><td><p>Anti-IgE therapy Systemic/oral corticosteroids (OCS) Anti-IL5 therapy\n</p><p>Special (phenotype-specific) treatments and interventions by specialized centers\n</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><p>aAdd-on therapies should be prescribed by specialized physicians with experience in asthma management\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><b>Table 4 </b>Controller therapyafter initial diagnosis\n</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><p>Presentation </p></td><td><p>Recommended initial therapyc\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>- Symptoms or need for SABA &lt;2×x/month\n</p><p>- No nocturnal awakening\n</p><p>- No risk factorsa for exacerbation\n</p><p>- No exacerbation in the last 12 months\n</p></td><td><p>No controller\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>- Symptoms or need for SABA &lt;2×/month\n</p><p>- No nocturnal awakening\n</p><p>- At least one risk factora for exacerbation or one exacerbation (with OCS therapy) in the last 12 months\n</p></td><td><p>Low-dose ICS\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>- Symptoms or need for SABA ≥2×/month\n</p><p>- Nocturnal awakening ≥1×/month\n</p></td><td><p>Low-dose ICS\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>- Symptoms or need for SABA >2×/month </p></td><td><p>Low-dose ICS\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>- Symptoms on most days\n</p><p>- Nocturnal awakening ≥1×/month\n</p><p>- At least one risk factora for an exacerbation\n</p></td><td><p>Medium-/high-dose ICS or low-dose ICS/LABAb\n</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p>aSee Table 6 b<i>Not </i>recommended as initial therapy for children up to age 11 years cSABA used on demand in all cases\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>cation. Three pharmaceutical categories are generally distinguished for long-term treatment (Table 3):\n</p><p>● <i>Controller</i>: Taken regularly. Reduces inflammation and exacerbation risk and controls symptoms.\n</p><p>● <i>Reliever</i>: Taken as necessary to reduce symptoms in case of asthma exacerbations. Also used for the short-term prevention of exercise-induced bron-choconstriction. It is a key objective of asthmaman-agement to keep the need for reliever to aminimum.\n</p><p>● <i>Add-on</i>: Used in patients with severe asthma and persistent symptoms or exacerbations despite high-dose combination therapy with ICS and optimization of modifiable risk factors.\n</p><p><i>Initial treatment after diagnosis\n</i></p><p>To achieve the best possible results, a maintenance therapy with a controller should be initiated as quickly as possible after the diagnosis of asthma (improves lung function or reduces deterioration of lung function after an exacerbation; see Table 4). Since GINA 2014, a low-dose ICS therapy has been listed as an option for older children and adults at step 1 for specific symptom and risk constellations. For preschool children with intermittent symptoms, the initial therapy consists of an inhaled short-acting beta-2-agonist (SABA). Further therapeutic steps are based on the degree of asthma control.\n</p><p><i>Stepwise approach for adjusting asthma treatment\n</i></p><p>The adjustment of asthma therapy is based on asthma control, and follows a step-up/step-down algorithm to increase or reduce the medication (Fig. 3). Regular follow-up should occur in a period of 2-3 months to optimize the treatment strategy. It is important to record symptom control, lung function, risk factors, inhalation technique, adherence, and nonpharmaco-logical strategies on a regular basis.\n</p><p>The gold standard in asthma therapy is still a low-dose ICS as a controller together with an on-demand Short-acting beta-2-agonist (SABA). An LTRA (Leuco-triene-receptor antagonist) can be tried as a second choice. There are also considerations that a combination product with low-dose ICS and long-acting beta-2-agonist (LABA) should be established in adults at this treatment stage (step 2) to ensure rapid treatment success. A further step-up from step 3 for adults calls for ICS-LABA combination therapy, with ICS in low doses. For children over the age of 12 years, an increased ICS dose is preferred over a combination therapy in this case. Two inhalers are also approved for additional rescue therapy: Formoterol/budesonide and formoterol/beclomethasone as basic therapy should be administered in the morning and at night and may also be inhaled by patients as needed (exacerbation). The ICS concentration in the combination product increases with the severity of the disease. Tiotropium may now be added to the management regimen as an\n</p><p><b>Fig. 3 </b>Stepalgorithmof asthma therapy for adults andchildrenolder than5years\n</p><p>additional treatment option. The use of theophylline preparations is still defined in the guidelines, but they are rarely employed in practical situations. A further innovation in the step-up algorithm is the application of an add-on therapy (e. g., anti-IgE for patients with severe asthma, who show a corresponding allergic predisposition prior to a systemic steroid therapy. In the same way as the step-algorithm provides for step-up options, it is important to reduce (step down) the therapy after the corresponding controls (after approximately 2-3 months) with good asthma control. Again, this requires a highly sensitive approach to quickly detect deteriorating symptoms and lung function, which may indicate an elevated risk of exacerbations. In principle, the goal should be to use the lowest ICS concentration that can guarantee optimal therapeutic success.\n</p><p>Asthma therapy for preschoolers basically has the same objectives as approaches for older children and adults and also follows a step scheme (step-up or step-down). In this age group, minimization of pharmaceutical side effects (e. g., body growth limitations from use of ICS) is especially important (see \"Preschoolers\").\n</p><p><i>Choice of inhaler\n</i></p><p>For children and adults, the choice of inhalers is based on individual skills (e. g., inspiratory flow) or barriers (e. g., arthritis, muscle weakness, impaired vision). Until early school age, most patients should use an inhaler with a suitable spacer. Oral/nasal masks should only be applied if the use of a mouthpiece is not possible (for reasons of age or compliance). In the age group of about 8 years and older, most patients use dry powder inhalers (DPI). If possible, patients should be involved in the choice of inhalers. Since there is no perfect tool, regular checks as well as training are necessary for the effective use of inhalers. The use of several different inhalers should be avoided to prevent confusion.\n</p><p><i>Steroid dosage\n</i></p><p>The bulk of ICS effects can be achieved with low doses; few studies are available on dose-response relationships for conventional doses. Low daily doses are not associated with clinically relevant adverse effects, but high doses pose a larger risk of systemic side effects with prolonged application (although this risk is smaller than with systemic application). ICS should be titrated to find the minimum effective dose that achieves good symptom control and a minimal risk of exacerbation. The dose ranges for each age group are listed in Table 5.\n</p><p><i>Specific immunotherapy\n</i></p><p>Although the GINA Guidelines are cautious in their recommendation of specific immunotherapy (SIT), an increasing volume of study data justifies its use in patients with mild-to-moderate, controlled allergic asthma [1]. It is important in each case that the allergen is a relevant asthma trigger (e. g., grass or birch pollen seasonally or house-dust mites as perennial allergens) and that the asthma is controlled (see Table 2).

GINA discusses the factors to be considered and lists the corresponding leverage points. The detection of risk factors in the living environment of the patient and the implementation of improvement measures require a time-intensive doctor-patient dialog as well as the patient's willingness to actively cooperate. Ultimately, successful asthma therapy is based on the complex interaction between doctor, patient, therapy, and the patient's environment.\n</p><p>The main modifiable factors listed in GINA are briefly summarized in Fig. 4.\n</p><p><i>Comorbidities\n</i></p><p>A number of health conditions can influence the course of asthma, thereby severely limiting asthma control and negatively affecting the patient's life quality.\n</p><p>The presence of an inflammatory disease in the upper airways (<i>rhinitis</i>, rhinosinusitis) increases the risk\n</p><p><b>Fig. 4 </b>Uncontrolledasthma-additional therapeuticmeasuresandmodifiable factors\n</p><p>of developing asthma. In all, 10-40% of patients with allergic rhinitis have asthma, suffer from more frequent exacerbations, and also need more rescue medication. Treating rhinopathy in patients with existing asthma is an important part of the therapy.\n</p><p>The heterogeneity of asthma can in part also be explained by the clinical characteristics of the comor-bidities. This also includes <i>obesity </i>asthma, which generally represents a therapeutic challenge. Additional factors such as obstructive sleep apnea, GERD and small lung volumes complicate management of this special type of asthma, which has been intensively researched over the past few years. Common therapy concepts such as ICS are not successful, while a weight loss of 5-10% leads to a significant improvement of asthma control and life quality.\n</p><p>GERD is a trigger frequently found in adults, which is not only associated with increased cough episodes, but can also trigger asthma attacks. Asthma medications such as beta-2-agonists and theophylline preparations can aggravate these symptoms. In the case of uncontrolled asthma, it is generally recommended to look for GERD and to prescribe an empirical anti-reflux therapy for at least 6 weeks if GERD is suspected. In some cases, an endoscopic investigation or a 24-h pH measurement is required. The treatment consists of a high-dose PPI (protone-pump inhibitor) medication. Surgical procedures (fundoplication) in patients with therapy-resistant asthma must be considered as a final resort.\n</p><p><i>Psychological disorders </i>are generally underestimated in asthma patients and often are associated with a low therapy adherence. Accordingly, these patients frequently experience exacerbations and have to seek emergency room treatment. Anxiety and depressive disorders should be professionally investigated, and patients should be trained to prepare for emergencies. Optimal pharmacological treatment is the basis for a better outcome in these patients.\n</p><p>In rare cases, <i>food allergies </i>are the triggers of asthma symptoms. Serious, even fatal reactions have been reported for patients with documented food-induced allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) and asthma. Because such patients frequently are allergic to peanuts or tree nuts, patients with food allergies should always be examined for the possible presence of asthma. Special allergological examinations can provide key information for the further management of these patients. In order to minimize the risk of an anaphylactic reaction, patients should receive a prescription for an adrenaline auto-injector and be instructed in its use.\n</p><p><i>Disorders in specific populations\n</i></p><p>Adolescents\n</p><p>This section makes specific reference to the developmental changes occurring primarily in this age group (social, emotional, physical etc.). A range of different behavioral tendencies (such as smoking) must be taken into account. It is recommended to create an in-\ndividual schedule that reflects the teen's life situation and daily routine (topic: inhalation therapy - when and how often?).\n</p><p>Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction Physical activities are an important trigger for the occurrence of asthma symptoms, although bronchocon-striction and the associated symptoms typically occur after exertion. Shortness of breath during exercise is more closely associated with a lack of physical fitness, obesity, or other illnesses. A well-founded pharmacological therapy can lead to significant improvements in exertion capacity, in which the administration of SABA can be sufficient to achieve substantial control. In some cases, regular treatment with ICS or ICS/ LABA is required. Therapy with LTRA has also proven successful with this form of asthma. Targeted training measures and sufficient warm-up are important aspects of therapy.\n</p><p>Asthma in pregnancy\n</p><p>To avoid asthma exacerbations during pregnancy, patients should continue their treatment according to the GINA Guidelines. Therapeutic adherence can be problematic because pregnant women find it less acceptable to use ICS. If the asthma is well controlled during pregnancy, the risk of complications for mother or child is low. The use of ICS, SABA, and LTRA is not associated with an increased incidence rate of fetal abnormalities. The principle of avoiding asthma exacerbations with optimal therapy is particularly important during pregnancy. Continued ICS therapy stabilizes the asthma, while a discontinuation elevates the risk of clinical deterioration.\n</p><p><i>Asthma training and self-management\n</i></p><p>GINA has a very clear position on the purpose of structured asthma training and nonpharmacological asthma management. The main content should be developed jointly and mainly concerns information on actions to take, training in self-management with recording of symptoms and possibly measurement of peak flow, the preparation of a written action plan, and regular follow-up for asthma control.\n</p><p>Training particularly focuses on the effective handling of the inhalation devices. Necessary steps include the selection of the most suitable inhaler for a specific age, reviewing inhalation technique, and demonstrations of correct application by the trainer. The patient should confirm the learning outcome by demonstrating the inhalation.\n</p><p>Therapeutic adherence should be checked at each visit, with recording of the possible causes of poor adherence. Around 50% of all adults and children using long-term asthma therapy do not properly comply with their treatment regimen. How can adherence be verified? The guidelines make a few suggestions, which are generally based on \"empathy\" questions that are not moralizing or patronizing. The guidelines again emphasize the importance of shared decisions for an individually implementable therapy. Information is part of every asthma training. It should be relevant for action and individually adapted to the development level of children. Training for preschoolers should be interactive, creative, and playful. It should be noted that information alone does not improve the outcome and should therefore only be part of a training that includes effective and practical aspects. It is recommended to address personal expectations, concerns, and fears so as to develop shared goals.\n</p><p>The communication of a self-management concept must reflect the personal situation of the family. Symptoms can be logged with a diary or an appropriate app. Given the low sensitivity and specificity of this method, peak flow measurement only makes sense in children who have severe or difficult-to-treat asthma.\n</p><p>The written asthma action plan that forms part of self-management should contain clear recommendations for the use of bronchodilation and anti-inflammatory therapy in acute and long-term management. In addition, it should be specified in detail how and when to seek medical assistance.\n</p><p>The benefits of telemedicine are seen as rather limited and should be primarily restricted to patients with severe forms of the disease. Regular medical consultation is regarded essential to implement the necessary aspects of pharmacological-based and nonpharmaco-logical-based asthma management.\n</p><p><b>Table 6 </b>Risk factors for asthmaexacerbationsor asthma-relateddeaths\n</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><p>Increased risk of asthma exacerbations\n</p></td><td><p>Increased risk of death\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Uncontrolled asthma symptoms\n</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p>High SABA usea\n</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>Use (currently or until recently) of OCS\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Inadequate ICS use (not prescribed, wrongly inhaled, poor adherence)\n</p></td><td><p>No ICS inhalations; poor adherence to prescribed asthma medications, no asthma action plan (or not followed)\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Low FEV1 (especially &lt;60% predicted)\n</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p>Serious psychosocial problems\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Exposed to: smoking, allergens (in case of existing allergy)\n</p></td><td><p>Existing food allergy\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sputum or blood eosinophilia\n</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Pregnancy\n</p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>Previously intubated or in an intensive care unit for asthma\n</p></td><td><p>Near-lethal episode with intubation and ventilation\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>≥1 serious exacerbations in the last 12 months\n</p></td><td><p>Hospitalization or presentation in the emergency room due to asthma in the last year\n</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p>aIncreased risk of death with >1 package of a salbutamol (or similar) MDI\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><b>Table 7 </b>Modificationofmedication in thecaseof asthmaexacerbation\n</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><p>Existing medication </p></td><td><p>Modification (for 1-2 weeks)\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><i>Reliever (or C&amp;R):\n</i></p><p>- SABA\n</p><p>- Low-dose ICS/formoterol (C&amp;R)\n</p></td><td><p><i>Increase reliever:\n</i></p><p>- Increase SABA frequency\n</p><p>- Increase reliever use (up to 72 µg/day formoterol)\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><i>Controller:\n</i></p><p>- ICS/formoterol (C&amp;R)a\n</p><p>- ICS + SABA\n</p><p>- ICS/formoterol (C) + SABA\n</p><p>- ICS/salmeterol + SABA\n</p></td><td><p><i>Increase controller:\n</i></p><p>- Increase ICS/formoterol use (up to 72 µg/day formoterol)\n</p><p>- Double ICS dose/increase to high-dose therapy step\n</p><p>- Quadruple ICS/formoterol use (up to 72 µg/day formoterol)\n</p><p>- Increase to high-dose ICS/salmeterol or ICS separately\n</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><i>Any therapy </i></p></td><td><p><i>Add OCS and seek medical assistance:\n</i></p><p>- OCS for severe exacerbations (for criteria, see above)\n</p><p>- Adults: 5-7 days 1 mg/kg/d prednisolone (max. 50 mg)\n</p><p>- Children: 3-5 days 1-2 mg/kg/day prednisolone (max. 40 mg)\n</p><p>- No wash-out phase required if administered &lt;2 weeks\n</p><p>- Double ICS dose/increase to high-dose therapy step\n</p><p>- Quadruple ICS/formoterol use (up to 72 µg/day formoterol)\n</p><p>- Increase to high-dose ICS/salmeterol or ICS separately\n</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><i>C </i>as controller, <i>R </i>as reliever aNot approved for children under 12 years of age\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><i>Management of asthma exacerbations\n</i></p><p>An asthma exacerbation is an episode with increasing shortness of breath, cough, and wheezing involving restricted lung function. It is commonly caused by known triggers (respiratory infection, pollen, air pollution). This deterioration can be described in different terms, such as exacerbation, episode, acute severe asthma, or \"flare-up.\" In addition to the aforementioned trigger factors of an asthma exacerbation, they also - occasionally at the same time - represent key risk factors for asthma-related death (Table 6).\n</p><p>Diagnosis of exacerbations\n</p><p>An exacerbation is defined as a deterioration of lung function (FEV1) and/or the occurrence or deterioration of respiratory symptoms. While lung function constitutes an objective indicator, especially for determining the severity of the exacerbation, the frequency of respiratory symptoms is often a more sensitive parameter. Particular attention must be paid to patients who are less skilled at noticing or articulating their symptoms (children, male patients, patients with a near-lethal asthma event in the past).\n</p><p>Themanagement of an asthma exacerbation occurs in stages and depends on the severity or the course. In principle, three stages can be distinguished:\n</p><p>● At home (self-management)\n</p><p>● At the family physician\n</p><p>● In the hospital/emergency room\n</p><p>Self-management (at home)\n</p><p>All asthma patients should be trained in self-management and receive a written asthma action plan, which defines individual criteria for the modification of the controller therapy and typically pertains to symptoms and a drop in the PEF (Peak Expiratory Flow) (e. g., >20% for more than 2 days). A general scheme is shown in Table 7 and Fig. 5.\n</p><p>Patients should be examined by a physician within 1-2 weeks of an exacerbation. In general, the controller therapy can be reduced to the original step after 2-4 weeks.\n</p><p>Management by a general practitioner or pediatrician In the medical setting, the following points need to be considered in the case of an exacerbation:\n</p><p>● Brief medical history and physical examination\n</p><p>● Assessment of exacerbation severity\n</p><p>● Prompt initiation of therapy Medical history should include:\n</p><p>● Time and cause of exacerbation\n</p><p>● Severity of symptoms (physical performance and sleep)\n</p><p>● Signs of anaphylaxis\n</p><p>● Risk factors for asthma-related death (Table 6)\n</p><p>● Medication (reliever and controller, adherence, and recent changes)\n</p><p>Clinical examination should include:\n</p><p>● Vital signs and signs of severity (see Fig. 6)\n</p><p>● Signs of complications (e. g., anaphylaxis, pneumonia, pneumothorax)\n</p><p>● Signs of alternative diagnoses (e. g., foreign body, pulmonary embolism, heart failure, dysfunction of the upper respiratory tract)\n</p><p>Antibiotic therapy plays no role in asthma exacerbations, unless there is clear evidence of a pulmonary infection (e. g., fever, purulent sputum, or radiologically documented infiltration).\n</p><p>Management in the emergency room/hospital Severe asthma exacerbations are life-threatening medical emergencies. Some 50-100 people still die of asthma in Austria every year (Austrian Statistics). It is usually safest to handle such emergencies in hospital emergency rooms (Fig. 7). This overview does not\n</p><p><b>Fig. 5 </b>Self-management in caseof exacerbations\n</p><p><b>Fig. 6 </b>Severity signsof an asthmaexacerbation\n</p><p>include any details on intensive-care management of asthma.\n</p><p>Analogous to the management provided by a general practitioner and/or pediatrician, the challenge is to quickly perform the three components (medical history and physical examination, assessment of severity, and prompt initiation of therapy). PEF and oxygen saturation measurement can be supplemented with a spirometry, arterial blood gas analysis and, if necessary, a chest X-ray.\n</p><p>Therapies not recommended for acute care include intravenous methylxanthine (poor risk-benefit profile), helium oxygen therapy (exceptional cases only), LTRA, antibiotics, and sedatives (increased mortality). The use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is controversial, particularly for agitated patients. Under no circumstances should the patient be sedated to allow for NIV.\n</p><p>The postdischarge therapy follows the same guidelines as for management by a general practitioner or pediatrician. Patients should be promptly and repeatedly evaluated by the physician providing treatment in the weeks following the exacerbation.\n</p><p><b>Fig. 7 </b>Managementof asthmaexacerbations in emergency rooms\n</p><p><i>Primary prevention\n</i></p><p>Asthma is a heterogeneous disease and ultimately the result of a gene-environment interaction. According to general consensus, there is a <b>\"</b>window of opportunity\" during pregnancy and early childhood, in which environmental factors can modify the development of asthma. GINA briefly addresses the most comprehensively studied factors, including breastfeeding, vitamin D, supplementary food, probiotics, inhaled allergens, tobacco smoke, microbial effects, drugs (antibiotics, paracetamol), as well as psychological aspects. At the end of the chapter, GINA provides a recommendation for generally applicable advice to parents regarding <i>primary asthma prevention</i>:\n</p><p>● Avoid exposure to second-hand smoke, especially during pregnancy and in the child's first year of life.\n</p><p>● Seek vaginal birth if possible.\n</p><p>● Breastfeed (generally positive health effects).\n</p><p>● Only use broad-spectrum antibiotics during pregnancy and in the child's first year of life if absolutely necessary.\n</p><p>For the other aforementioned factors, there are either insufficient data (or partly controversial) to give a general recommendation or the approaches are not generally applicable to everyone (e. g., growing up on a farm).\n</p><p><b>Preschoolers\n</b></p><p>For the age group 0-5 years, there are significant differences in the entire asthma management from diagnosis to therapy [2]. Therefore this group is discussed in a separate section of the GINA Guidelines.\n</p><p><i>Diagnosis\n</i></p><p>The possibility of a first manifestation in infants or toddlers makes diagnostic determination difficult in this age group because congenital disorders and a wide range of differential diagnostic possibilities (see Table 1) have to be taken into account and may need to be investigated along with perinatal aspects.\n</p><p>A special feature in this age group is that many children suffer from asthma-like symptoms, while the number of children who are completely symptom-free in later life is very high. Children under 3 years of age commonly exhibit wheezing within the context of viral infections, and every third child suffers from episodic symptoms, frequently with excellent long-term prognosis. There are no reliable tests to distinguish between transient symptoms and true early childhood asthma - with the associated need for therapy.\n</p><p>The most significant indicators of early childhood asthma include:\n</p><p>● Typical symptoms such as wheezing and coughing without an infection, also frequently during exertion/laughing/crying as well as reduced activity level and particularly nocturnal symptoms\n</p><p>● Risk factors for asthma (especially positive family history of allergies or asthma)\n</p><p>● Response to a therapy attempt with low-dose ICS and SABA on demand for 2-3months\n</p><p>The following additional examinations may be considered:\n</p><p>● <i>Allergy test: </i>Reasonable because many children show relevant sensitization even under 3 years of age. For example, sensitivity to house-dust mites is associated with increased asthma risk.\n</p><p>● <i>Lung function diagnostics</i>: Children usually have to be 5-6 years old before spirometry is possible, but it can be attempted earlier with sufficient expertise and time investment. The GINA Guidelines do not make any reference to alternative technologies (forced oscillation, impulse oscillometry, multiple-breath washout etc.). In addition, these techniques currently are only available in specialized centers.\n</p><p>● <i>Exhaled NO: </i>Listed as a possible examination (tidal technique) in the GINA Guidelines, but not yet established for young children (apart from scientific applications). As soon as spirometry is possible, the forced expiratory flow maneuver can usually be employed in a defined flow range (\"single-breath\" method).\n</p><p>● <i>Further tests</i>, mainly to rule out differential diagnoses: In addition to the lung X-ray specified in the GINA Guidelines, further examinations (bronchoscopy, sweat test, pH measurement etc.) may be required. However, they are not part of the primary diagnosis.\n</p><p><i>Therapy and management\n</i></p><p>Asthma control plays an important role, as in older children and adults. The GINA Guidelines offer a table on asthma control, which is similar to the table for older children and adults (see Table 2). It distinguis-\n</p><p><b>Fig. 8 </b>Stepalgorithmof asthma therapy for children ≤5years\n</p><p>hes between well-controlled, partly controlled, and uncontrolled asthma. In the case of young children, criteria are a little stricter (e. g., daily symptoms or SABA demand more than once a week compared with twice a week for older children; nocturnal cough is listed in addition to nocturnal awakening).\n</p><p><i>Pharmacological therapy\n</i></p><p>Pharmacological therapy follows a step algorithm, similar to older children, which is adapted to the age group (Fig. 8). An inhaled SABA on demand is the first choice in step 1; this on-demand therapy is recommended for all further therapy steps.\n</p><p>It is further recommended to refer the patient to a specialist from step 4 (if increasing the daily ICS dose does not lead to any improvement). Compared with previous guidelines, the administration of LTRA has declined in significance and is only recommended as an option. Current Austrian recommendations [7] also give preference to a primary therapy with low-dose ICS over an initial therapy with LTRA, since most of the children (especially those with allergies) benefit more from therapy with ICS. The GINAGuidelines also point out that oral administration of a beta-2-agonist is not recommended owing to the slower onset and higher rate of side effects.\n</p><p>The selection of the optimal inhaler for application of ICS and SABA is equally relevant for preschoolers because they can only properly inhale when breathing normally. The choice of inhaler is based on the child's age and ability. The preferred device for preschoolers is a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer and valve. It should have a mask for children under 4 years of age and a mouthpiece for most children from 4 years on. It is important to know that the administered medication dose may vary considerably among different spacers. Nebulizers can be used as an alternative for the few preschool children who cannot inhale effectively in spite of practicing with ametered dose inhaler with spacer.\n</p><p>Regular re-evaluation and adjustment of the therapy is particularly important in this age group. Follow-up should occur within 3 months after every therapy modification.\n</p><p><i>Asthma training and asthma plan\n</i></p><p>Asthma training also makes sense for this age group. Emphasis should be on basic information about asthma, communicating the right inhalation technique and presenting a written asthma action plan (see also\n</p><p>\"Asthma training and self-management\").\n</p><p>The onset of symptoms, severity, presence of differential diagnostic information, considerations concerning the inhalation technique, and, in many cases, inadequate therapeutic success frequently lead to the involvement of pediatric experts. This is highly relevant, since development-related aspects must be considered along with the fact that the absence of symptoms must be the objective of the treatment for this age group as well.\n</p><p><b>Conclusion\n</b></p><p>Guidelines contribute to a standardized, uniform approach for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of major diseases. The GINA Guidelines have supported this effort in the area of asthma management for many years. New additions to the current guidelines include a differentiated definition of asthma that makes specific reference to the heterogeneous symptoms of the disease and no longer emphasizes bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The guidelines strongly encourage regular adaptation of the therapy regimen and the consistent reassessment of patients with different methods (clinical, lung function etc.). The role of ICS is highlighted in therapeutic aspects. These pharmaceuticals should be used at an early point in the course of the disease, preferably in low doses. ICS are now given priority over LTRA in the treatment of young children. At the highest treatment step, the concept of add-on therapy is recommended over an OCS therapy for adults. The guidelines again place particular emphasis on selecting the right inhaler and providing adequate asthma training. The implementation of the existing guidelines in routine treatment of asthma patients will be important for the future. Sufficient resources are necessary to enable training for private practitioners in hospitals as well as a comprehensive training program for asthma patients.\n</p><p>Open access funding provided by Paracelsus Medical University.\n</p><p><b>Conflict of interest </b>F.

For further details, please refer to the individual relevant sections of the GINA Guidelines, which are available online (http://www. ginasthma.org).\n\nDefinition and diagnosis\n\nDefinition\n\nAsthma is a heterogeneous,multifactorial disease with variable andmostly reversible respiratory pathway obstruction based on a chronic bronchial inflammatory reaction. The symptoms (cough, rhonchus, wheezing, chest tightness, or shortness of breath) are variable and correlated with expiratory flow limitation. Although bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) is often present, the current GINA Guidelines no longer include it as a necessary or sufficient criterion for diagnosis.\n\nPhenotypes\n\nOwing to the heterogeneity of the disease, a number of different phenotypes can be described. Distinguishing between them can be particularly relevant to the therapy in severe cases:\n\n● Allergic asthma\n\n● Nonallergic asthma\n\n● Pediatric asthma/recurrent obstructive bronchitis\n\n● Late-onset asthma\n\n● Asthma with fixed airflow obstruction\n\n● Obesity asthma\n\n● Occupational asthma\n\n● Asthma in the elderly\n\n● Severe asthma\n\nClassifications by other professional associations (ERS/ATS, European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society) tend to focus more on a combination of clinical and pathophysiological aspects (e. g., eosinophilic/neutrophilic asthma, severe allergic asthma etc.).\n\nInitial diagnosis\n\nDiagnostic criteria and supplementary examinations Asthma may be suspected if the patient has a positive medical history of recurrent dry coughing, especially at night, rhonchus, wheezing, chest tightness, or shortness of breath.\n\nLung function testing can confirm the diagnosis if an airway obstruction is found reversible based on an FEV1 (Forced expiratory Volume in 1 second) increase of >12% and >200 ml (in adults) after administering 200-400 µg salbutamol. If there is clinical suspicion, but the lung function is normal, further bronchial challenge testing (e. g., with methacholine or indirect tests such as running exertion or inhalation of hype-rosmolar solutions) may be helpful, especially to determine bronchial hyperresponsiveness in adults. Furthermore, an FEV1 increase of +12% and >200 ml (in adults) after 4 weeks of anti-inflammatory therapy is considered diagnostic confirmation.\n\nIf an allergic trigger is suspected, an allergy diagnosis consisting of medical history, skin prick test, and/or definition of the specific IgE (Immunoglobu-line group E) should be performed. This should also include sensitizations that are not clinically relevant because they can provide prognostic information. Measuring fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) has not yet become an established practice in general asthma management and is not recommended in the current guidelines for a general therapy decision [6]. Nevertheless, in the view of this statement's authors, there are several indications in which an Fe-NO measurement makes sense, such as, for example: (1) as another component of asthma diagnosis in difficult cases (normal lung function, unclear symptoms), (2) to check on therapeutic adherence regarding inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), or (3) for the early detection of worsening asthma.\n\nDifferential diagnosis\n\nThe differential diagnosis for asthma in adults over 40 years of age should primarily consider chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), sinusitis, or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The distinction between asthma and COPD can be difficult since symptoms may overlap, change, or exist in parallel (ACOS Asthma-COPD overlap syndrome). In younger patients, acute infections, congenital malformations (respiratory or heart), or foreign body aspirations may be more prominent (Table 1).\n\nFollow-up\n\nAsthma follow-up: symptoms and minimization of future risks\n\nAsthma therapy aims to achieve maximum freedom from symptoms (nocturnal awakening, need for rescue medication, activity restrictions) and, thereby, maximum quality of life (Table 2). This can in most cases be achieved with consistent therapy. Therapeutic adherence is a problem because patients often do not suffer in spite of poor lung function and discontinue their therapy without asking their physician once they have experienced a quick response. Regular lung function controls are necessary, and a questionnaire such as the Asthma Control Test (ACT) can provide additional help for evaluating therapeutic efficacy in relation to symptom control.\n\nTable 1 Commondifferential diagnoses for asthma\n\n≤5 years 6-11 years 12-39 years 40+ years\n\nRecurrent viral infections X\n\nGastroesophageal reflux X\n\nCongenital malformations (tracheomalacia, vascular ring etc.) X\n\nTuberculosis X\n\nProtracted bacterial bronchitis X\n\nImmunodeficiency X\n\nPCD X X\n\nBPD X X\n\nForeign body aspiration X X X\n\nCongenital heart defects X X X\n\nCystic fibrosis X X X\n\nChronic cough (upper respiratory tract) X X\n\nBronchiectasis X X X\n\nVCD X X\n\nHyperventilation X X\n\nAlpha1-antitrypsin deficiency X X\n\nCOPD X\n\nLeft ventricular heart failure X\n\nDrug-related cough X\n\nParenchymatous lung disease X\n\nPulmonary embolism X\n\nCentral airway obstruction X\n\nAccording to GINA update 2015, modified by the author team PCD primary ciliary dyskinesia, BPD bronchopulmonary dysplasia, VCD vocal cord dysfunction, COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n\nTable 2 Asthmacontrol according toGINA for adults and children\n\nSymptoms in the past 4 weeks Asthma symptom control\n\nWell-controlled Partly controlled Uncontrolled\n\nDaytime symptoms more than 2×/week (or 1×/weeka) No criterion applies 1-2 criteria apply 3-4 criteria apply\n\nNocturnal awakening due to asthma (or coughinga) at any time\n\nReliever >2×/week (or >1×/weeka)\n\nAny limitation of daily activity due to asthma\n\naIn children ≤5 years\n\nRisk minimization includes smoking cessation, optimal protection from contaminants in the workplace, and specific immunotherapy.\n\nLung function control\n\nA lung function test should be performed for diagnosis or prior to starting therapy. Follow-up should occur individually based on asthma severity/symptoms in intervals of 3-6 months. In addition to these recommendations of the GINA Guidelines, lung function testing, performed approximately 4-6 weeks after a change of therapy, has proven successful for controlling treatment efficacy. A minimally relevant change in the FEV1 is indicated as 10%.\n\nSpirometry can generally be performed in children from about 6 years of age. Prior to that, diagnosis and follow-up have to rely on clinical parameters (see \"Preschoolers\"). It is important to note that spirometry results tend to be normal in many children with asthma and only show FEV1 restrictions during exacerbations.\n\nDetermination of asthma severity\n\nThe classification of asthma severity has fundamentally changed over the past years. Traditionally, the degree of severity (intermittent, mild, persistent etc.) was based on symptoms and the use of rescue inhalers and limited lung function. Strictly speaking, this classification only applied to untreated patients. Since the response to treatment is essential, GINA has recommended the concept of asthma control and therapy steps since 2006. Severity therefore is no longer a snapshot, but is established retrospectively after a treatment period of several months and can change over time. It results from the therapy step that is required to achieve asthma control (see Table 2):\n\n● Mild asthma: therapy step 1 or 2\n\n● Moderate asthma: therapy step 3\n\n● Severe asthma: therapy step 4 or 5\n\nFig. 1 Investigationof apatientwithpoor symptomcontrol or exacerbationsdespite therapy\n\nIn addition, the concept of severe asthma was clearly defined and differentiated from other terms such as uncontrolled or \"difficult-to-treat\" asthma. An exact definition can be found in a separate ERS/ATS guideline from 2014, to which GINA also makes reference [3]. \"Severe asthma\" is reserved for patients with actual therapy-resistant asthma after other factors such as poor inhalation technique and adherence to therapy, risk factors, continuous exposure to trigger factors (e. g., allergens, smoke) or co-morbidities have been excluded or optimally treated and the patient has received treatment from an asthma specialist for at least 3 months (see Fig. 1).\n\nThe World Health Organization term \"untreated severe asthma\" (common in countries with inadequate treatment options) also is no longer included in this definition of severe asthma.\n\nIt should also be noted that therapy steps 4 and 5 according to GINA or ERS/ATS have significant differences based on the defined limit values for high-dose ICS therapy (doses according to ERS/ATS are in part double compared with GINA). This has an indirect effect on the definition of severe asthma.\n\nTherapy and management\n\nGoals\n\nGeneral long-term objectives of asthma management include:\n\n● Achieving symptom control and maintaining normal physical performance\n\n● Minimizing the risk of exacerbations, fixed airway obstruction, and side effects of the therapy\n\nFig. 2 Cycleof asthmacontrol\n\nFurthermore, individual goals should be discussed with the patient and taken into account. A good partnership between the patient and the physician is essential for effective asthma management. Physicians should have good communication skills to encourage patients to take part in decisions and to express their needs and concerns. Patient self-management and knowledge about asthma should be promoted with training, as studies have documented positive effects on morbidity in adults and children.\n\nControl-based asthma management\n\nModern asthma treatment (pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapy) is based on the concept of asthma control, which has been shown to improve the treatment success. This concept is based on a cycle of assess, adjust, and review (see Fig. 2).\n\nSymptom control is usually associated with reduced asthma exacerbations. In the case of more severe forms, symptom control can occasionally not be paired with a reduced exacerbation rate. That makes it important to consider both factors of asthma control (symptoms and exacerbation risk).\n\nAs an alternative, other concepts such as therapy based on sputum or FeNO may be used in special cases, e. g., severe or difficult-to-treat asthma.\n\nDrug therapy\n\nInhalation therapy is the application of choice for asthma. It leads to higher local concentrations, fewer systemic side effects, and, accordingly, to generally very good tolerance compared with systemic appli-\n\nTable 3 Medicationcategories for asthma treatment\n\nController Reliever Add-on therapya\n\nInhaled corticosteroid (ICS) ICS/LABA (long-acting beta-2-agonist) combination Leukotriene receptor agonists (LTRA) Long-acting anticholinergics (LAMA) Methylxanthines (theophylline) Chromones (practically no longer in use) Short-acting beta-2-agonists (SABA) Short-acting anticholinergics (LAMA) Anti-IgE therapy Systemic/oral corticosteroids (OCS) Anti-IL5 therapy Special (phenotype-specific) treatments and interventions by specialized centers\n\naAdd-on therapies should be prescribed by specialized physicians with experience in asthma management\n\nTable 4 Controller therapyafter initial diagnosis\n\nPresentation Recommended initial therapyc\n\n- Symptoms or need for SABA <2×x/month - No nocturnal awakening - No risk factorsa for exacerbation - No exacerbation in the last 12 months No controller\n\n- Symptoms or need for SABA <2×/month - No nocturnal awakening - At least one risk factora for exacerbation or one exacerbation (with OCS therapy) in the last 12 months Low-dose ICS\n\n- Symptoms or need for SABA ≥2×/month - Nocturnal awakening ≥1×/month Low-dose ICS\n\n- Symptoms or need for SABA >2×/month Low-dose ICS\n\n- Symptoms on most days - Nocturnal awakening ≥1×/month - At least one risk factora for an exacerbation Medium-/high-dose ICS or low-dose ICS/LABAb\n\naSee Table 6 bNot recommended as initial therapy for children up to age 11 years cSABA used on demand in all cases\n\ncation. Three pharmaceutical categories are generally distinguished for long-term treatment (Table 3):\n\n● Controller: Taken regularly. Reduces inflammation and exacerbation risk and controls symptoms.\n\n● Reliever: Taken as necessary to reduce symptoms in case of asthma exacerbations. Also used for the short-term prevention of exercise-induced bron-choconstriction. It is a key objective of asthmaman-agement to keep the need for reliever to aminimum.\n\n● Add-on: Used in patients with severe asthma and persistent symptoms or exacerbations despite high-dose combination therapy with ICS and optimization of modifiable risk factors.\n\nInitial treatment after diagnosis\n\nTo achieve the best possible results, a maintenance therapy with a controller should be initiated as quickly as possible after the diagnosis of asthma (improves lung function or reduces deterioration of lung function after an exacerbation; see Table 4). Since GINA 2014, a low-dose ICS therapy has been listed as an option for older children and adults at step 1 for specific symptom and risk constellations. For preschool children with intermittent symptoms, the initial therapy consists of an inhaled short-acting beta-2-agonist (SABA). Further therapeutic steps are based on the degree of asthma control.\n\nStepwise approach for adjusting asthma treatment\n\nThe adjustment of asthma therapy is based on asthma control, and follows a step-up/step-down algorithm to increase or reduce the medication (Fig. 3). Regular follow-up should occur in a period of 2-3 months to optimize the treatment strategy. It is important to record symptom control, lung function, risk factors, inhalation technique, adherence, and nonpharmaco-logical strategies on a regular basis.\n\nThe gold standard in asthma therapy is still a low-dose ICS as a controller together with an on-demand Short-acting beta-2-agonist (SABA). An LTRA (Leuco-triene-receptor antagonist) can be tried as a second choice. There are also considerations that a combination product with low-dose ICS and long-acting beta-2-agonist (LABA) should be established in adults at this treatment stage (step 2) to ensure rapid treatment success. A further step-up from step 3 for adults calls for ICS-LABA combination therapy, with ICS in low doses. For children over the age of 12 years, an increased ICS dose is preferred over a combination therapy in this case. Two inhalers are also approved for additional rescue therapy: Formoterol/budesonide and formoterol/beclomethasone as basic therapy should be administered in the morning and at night and may also be inhaled by patients as needed (exacerbation). The ICS concentration in the combination product increases with the severity of the disease. Tiotropium may now be added to the management regimen as an\n\nFig. 3 Stepalgorithmof asthma therapy for adults andchildrenolder than5years\n\nadditional treatment option. The use of theophylline preparations is still defined in the guidelines, but they are rarely employed in practical situations. A further innovation in the step-up algorithm is the application of an add-on therapy (e. g., anti-IgE for patients with severe asthma, who show a corresponding allergic predisposition prior to a systemic steroid therapy. In the same way as the step-algorithm provides for step-up options, it is important to reduce (step down) the therapy after the corresponding controls (after approximately 2-3 months) with good asthma control. Again, this requires a highly sensitive approach to quickly detect deteriorating symptoms and lung function, which may indicate an elevated risk of exacerbations. In principle, the goal should be to use the lowest ICS concentration that can guarantee optimal therapeutic success.\n\nAsthma therapy for preschoolers basically has the same objectives as approaches for older children and adults and also follows a step scheme (step-up or step-down). In this age group, minimization of pharmaceutical side effects (e. g., body growth limitations from use of ICS) is especially important (see \"Preschoolers\").\n\nChoice of inhaler\n\nFor children and adults, the choice of inhalers is based on individual skills (e. g., inspiratory flow) or barriers (e. g., arthritis, muscle weakness, impaired vision). Until early school age, most patients should use an inhaler with a suitable spacer. Oral/nasal masks should only be applied if the use of a mouthpiece is not possible (for reasons of age or compliance). In the age group of about 8 years and older, most patients use dry powder inhalers (DPI). If possible, patients should be involved in the choice of inhalers. Since there is no perfect tool, regular checks as well as training are necessary for the effective use of inhalers. The use of several different inhalers should be avoided to prevent confusion.\n\nSteroid dosage\n\nThe bulk of ICS effects can be achieved with low doses; few studies are available on dose-response relationships for conventional doses. Low daily doses are not associated with clinically relevant adverse effects, but high doses pose a larger risk of systemic side effects with prolonged application (although this risk is smaller than with systemic application). ICS should be titrated to find the minimum effective dose that achieves good symptom control and a minimal risk of exacerbation. The dose ranges for each age group are listed in Table 5.\n\nSpecific immunotherapy\n\nAlthough the GINA Guidelines are cautious in their recommendation of specific immunotherapy (SIT), an increasing volume of study data justifies its use in patients with mild-to-moderate, controlled allergic asthma [1]. It is important in each case that the allergen is a relevant asthma trigger (e. g., grass or birch pollen seasonally or house-dust mites as perennial allergens) and that the asthma is controlled (see Table 2).

Proper allergy diagnosis and the use of standardized vaccines are prerequisites for successful immunotherapy.\n\nThe treatment of asthma patients with specific immunotherapy should only be performed by doctors who are familiar with asthma management. Meticulous asthma control is required, especially in the step-up phase, for the problem-free performance of a specific immunotherapy.\n\nSubcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) is still the gold standard for treatment. However, a significant reduction of steroid use and exacerbations was recently demonstrated with the use of a sublingual high-dose house-dust mite tablet in asthma patients [5].\n\nNonpharmacological therapy\n\nThis section particularly refers to those patients who continue to suffer from asthma exacerbations in spite of presumably optimal or even maximum pharmacological therapy (see also \"difficult-to-treat asthma\"). However, many of the points listed, especially the avoidable factors (e. g., smoking, inactivity) are of relevance for all other asthma patients as well.\n\nThe identification of modifiable factors frequently leads to ultimate success. GINA discusses the factors to be considered and lists the corresponding leverage points. The detection of risk factors in the living environment of the patient and the implementation of improvement measures require a time-intensive doctor-patient dialog as well as the patient's willingness to actively cooperate. Ultimately, successful asthma therapy is based on the complex interaction between doctor, patient, therapy, and the patient's environment.\n\nThe main modifiable factors listed in GINA are briefly summarized in Fig. 4.\n\nComorbidities\n\nA number of health conditions can influence the course of asthma, thereby severely limiting asthma control and negatively affecting the patient's life quality.\n\nThe presence of an inflammatory disease in the upper airways (rhinitis, rhinosinusitis) increases the risk\n\nFig. 4 Uncontrolledasthma-additional therapeuticmeasuresandmodifiable factors\n\nof developing asthma. In all, 10-40% of patients with allergic rhinitis have asthma, suffer from more frequent exacerbations, and also need more rescue medication. Treating rhinopathy in patients with existing asthma is an important part of the therapy.\n\nThe heterogeneity of asthma can in part also be explained by the clinical characteristics of the comor-bidities. This also includes obesity asthma, which generally represents a therapeutic challenge. Additional factors such as obstructive sleep apnea, GERD and small lung volumes complicate management of this special type of asthma, which has been intensively researched over the past few years. Common therapy concepts such as ICS are not successful, while a weight loss of 5-10% leads to a significant improvement of asthma control and life quality.\n\nGERD is a trigger frequently found in adults, which is not only associated with increased cough episodes, but can also trigger asthma attacks. Asthma medications such as beta-2-agonists and theophylline preparations can aggravate these symptoms. In the case of uncontrolled asthma, it is generally recommended to look for GERD and to prescribe an empirical anti-reflux therapy for at least 6 weeks if GERD is suspected. In some cases, an endoscopic investigation or a 24-h pH measurement is required. The treatment consists of a high-dose PPI (protone-pump inhibitor) medication. Surgical procedures (fundoplication) in patients with therapy-resistant asthma must be considered as a final resort.\n\nPsychological disorders are generally underestimated in asthma patients and often are associated with a low therapy adherence. Accordingly, these patients frequently experience exacerbations and have to seek emergency room treatment. Anxiety and depressive disorders should be professionally investigated, and patients should be trained to prepare for emergencies. Optimal pharmacological treatment is the basis for a better outcome in these patients.\n\nIn rare cases, food allergies are the triggers of asthma symptoms. Serious, even fatal reactions have been reported for patients with documented food-induced allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) and asthma. Because such patients frequently are allergic to peanuts or tree nuts, patients with food allergies should always be examined for the possible presence of asthma. Special allergological examinations can provide key information for the further management of these patients. In order to minimize the risk of an anaphylactic reaction, patients should receive a prescription for an adrenaline auto-injector and be instructed in its use.\n\nDisorders in specific populations\n\nAdolescents\n\nThis section makes specific reference to the developmental changes occurring primarily in this age group (social, emotional, physical etc.). A range of different behavioral tendencies (such as smoking) must be taken into account. It is recommended to create an in- dividual schedule that reflects the teen's life situation and daily routine (topic: inhalation therapy - when and how often?).\n\nExercise-induced bronchoconstriction Physical activities are an important trigger for the occurrence of asthma symptoms, although bronchocon-striction and the associated symptoms typically occur after exertion. Shortness of breath during exercise is more closely associated with a lack of physical fitness, obesity, or other illnesses. A well-founded pharmacological therapy can lead to significant improvements in exertion capacity, in which the administration of SABA can be sufficient to achieve substantial control. In some cases, regular treatment with ICS or ICS/ LABA is required. Therapy with LTRA has also proven successful with this form of asthma. Targeted training measures and sufficient warm-up are important aspects of therapy.\n\nAsthma in pregnancy\n\nTo avoid asthma exacerbations during pregnancy, patients should continue their treatment according to the GINA Guidelines. Therapeutic adherence can be problematic because pregnant women find it less acceptable to use ICS. If the asthma is well controlled during pregnancy, the risk of complications for mother or child is low. The use of ICS, SABA, and LTRA is not associated with an increased incidence rate of fetal abnormalities. The principle of avoiding asthma exacerbations with optimal therapy is particularly important during pregnancy. Continued ICS therapy stabilizes the asthma, while a discontinuation elevates the risk of clinical deterioration.\n\nAsthma training and self-management\n\nGINA has a very clear position on the purpose of structured asthma training and nonpharmacological asthma management. The main content should be developed jointly and mainly concerns information on actions to take, training in self-management with recording of symptoms and possibly measurement of peak flow, the preparation of a written action plan, and regular follow-up for asthma control.\n\nTraining particularly focuses on the effective handling of the inhalation devices. Necessary steps include the selection of the most suitable inhaler for a specific age, reviewing inhalation technique, and demonstrations of correct application by the trainer. The patient should confirm the learning outcome by demonstrating the inhalation.\n\nTherapeutic adherence should be checked at each visit, with recording of the possible causes of poor adherence. Around 50% of all adults and children using long-term asthma therapy do not properly comply with their treatment regimen. How can adherence be verified? The guidelines make a few suggestions, which are generally based on \"empathy\" questions that are not moralizing or patronizing. The guidelines again emphasize the importance of shared decisions for an individually implementable therapy. Information is part of every asthma training. It should be relevant for action and individually adapted to the development level of children. Training for preschoolers should be interactive, creative, and playful. It should be noted that information alone does not improve the outcome and should therefore only be part of a training that includes effective and practical aspects. It is recommended to address personal expectations, concerns, and fears so as to develop shared goals.\n\nThe communication of a self-management concept must reflect the personal situation of the family. Symptoms can be logged with a diary or an appropriate app. Given the low sensitivity and specificity of this method, peak flow measurement only makes sense in children who have severe or difficult-to-treat asthma.\n\nThe written asthma action plan that forms part of self-management should contain clear recommendations for the use of bronchodilation and anti-inflammatory therapy in acute and long-term management. In addition, it should be specified in detail how and when to seek medical assistance.\n\nThe benefits of telemedicine are seen as rather limited and should be primarily restricted to patients with severe forms of the disease. Regular medical consultation is regarded essential to implement the necessary aspects of pharmacological-based and nonpharmaco-logical-based asthma management.\n\nTable 6 Risk factors for asthmaexacerbationsor asthma-relateddeaths\n\nIncreased risk of asthma exacerbations Increased risk of death\n\nUncontrolled asthma symptoms\n\nHigh SABA usea\n\nUse (currently or until recently) of OCS\n\nInadequate ICS use (not prescribed, wrongly inhaled, poor adherence) No ICS inhalations; poor adherence to prescribed asthma medications, no asthma action plan (or not followed)\n\nLow FEV1 (especially <60% predicted)\n\nSerious psychosocial problems\n\nExposed to: smoking, allergens (in case of existing allergy) Existing food allergy\n\nSputum or blood eosinophilia\n\nPregnancy\n\nPreviously intubated or in an intensive care unit for asthma Near-lethal episode with intubation and ventilation\n\n≥1 serious exacerbations in the last 12 months Hospitalization or presentation in the emergency room due to asthma in the last year\n\naIncreased risk of death with >1 package of a salbutamol (or similar) MDI\n\nTable 7 Modificationofmedication in thecaseof asthmaexacerbation\n\nExisting medication Modification (for 1-2 weeks)\n\nReliever (or C&R): - SABA - Low-dose ICS/formoterol (C&R) Increase reliever: - Increase SABA frequency - Increase reliever use (up to 72 µg/day formoterol)\n\nController: - ICS/formoterol (C&R)a - ICS + SABA - ICS/formoterol (C) + SABA - ICS/salmeterol + SABA Increase controller: - Increase ICS/formoterol use (up to 72 µg/day formoterol) - Double ICS dose/increase to high-dose therapy step - Quadruple ICS/formoterol use (up to 72 µg/day formoterol) - Increase to high-dose ICS/salmeterol or ICS separately\n\nAny therapy Add OCS and seek medical assistance: - OCS for severe exacerbations (for criteria, see above) - Adults: 5-7 days 1 mg/kg/d prednisolone (max. 50 mg) - Children: 3-5 days 1-2 mg/kg/day prednisolone (max. 40 mg) - No wash-out phase required if administered <2 weeks - Double ICS dose/increase to high-dose therapy step - Quadruple ICS/formoterol use (up to 72 µg/day formoterol) - Increase to high-dose ICS/salmeterol or ICS separately\n\nC as controller, R as reliever aNot approved for children under 12 years of age\n\nManagement of asthma exacerbations\n\nAn asthma exacerbation is an episode with increasing shortness of breath, cough, and wheezing involving restricted lung function. It is commonly caused by known triggers (respiratory infection, pollen, air pollution). This deterioration can be described in different terms, such as exacerbation, episode, acute severe asthma, or \"flare-up.\" In addition to the aforementioned trigger factors of an asthma exacerbation, they also - occasionally at the same time - represent key risk factors for asthma-related death (Table 6).\n\nDiagnosis of exacerbations\n\nAn exacerbation is defined as a deterioration of lung function (FEV1) and/or the occurrence or deterioration of respiratory symptoms. While lung function constitutes an objective indicator, especially for determining the severity of the exacerbation, the frequency of respiratory symptoms is often a more sensitive parameter. Particular attention must be paid to patients who are less skilled at noticing or articulating their symptoms (children, male patients, patients with a near-lethal asthma event in the past).\n\nThemanagement of an asthma exacerbation occurs in stages and depends on the severity or the course. In principle, three stages can be distinguished:\n\n● At home (self-management)\n\n● At the family physician\n\n● In the hospital/emergency room\n\nSelf-management (at home)\n\nAll asthma patients should be trained in self-management and receive a written asthma action plan, which defines individual criteria for the modification of the controller therapy and typically pertains to symptoms and a drop in the PEF (Peak Expiratory Flow) (e. g., >20% for more than 2 days). A general scheme is shown in Table 7 and Fig. 5.\n\nPatients should be examined by a physician within 1-2 weeks of an exacerbation. In general, the controller therapy can be reduced to the original step after 2-4 weeks.\n\nManagement by a general practitioner or pediatrician In the medical setting, the following points need to be considered in the case of an exacerbation:\n\n● Brief medical history and physical examination\n\n● Assessment of exacerbation severity\n\n● Prompt initiation of therapy Medical history should include:\n\n● Time and cause of exacerbation\n\n● Severity of symptoms (physical performance and sleep)\n\n● Signs of anaphylaxis\n\n● Risk factors for asthma-related death (Table 6)\n\n● Medication (reliever and controller, adherence, and recent changes)\n\nClinical examination should include:\n\n● Vital signs and signs of severity (see Fig. 6)\n\n● Signs of complications (e. g., anaphylaxis, pneumonia, pneumothorax)\n\n● Signs of alternative diagnoses (e. g., foreign body, pulmonary embolism, heart failure, dysfunction of the upper respiratory tract)\n\nAntibiotic therapy plays no role in asthma exacerbations, unless there is clear evidence of a pulmonary infection (e. g., fever, purulent sputum, or radiologically documented infiltration).\n\nManagement in the emergency room/hospital Severe asthma exacerbations are life-threatening medical emergencies. Some 50-100 people still die of asthma in Austria every year (Austrian Statistics). It is usually safest to handle such emergencies in hospital emergency rooms (Fig. 7). This overview does not\n\nFig. 5 Self-management in caseof exacerbations\n\nFig. 6 Severity signsof an asthmaexacerbation\n\ninclude any details on intensive-care management of asthma.\n\nAnalogous to the management provided by a general practitioner and/or pediatrician, the challenge is to quickly perform the three components (medical history and physical examination, assessment of severity, and prompt initiation of therapy). PEF and oxygen saturation measurement can be supplemented with a spirometry, arterial blood gas analysis and, if necessary, a chest X-ray.\n\nTherapies not recommended for acute care include intravenous methylxanthine (poor risk-benefit profile), helium oxygen therapy (exceptional cases only), LTRA, antibiotics, and sedatives (increased mortality). The use of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is controversial, particularly for agitated patients. Under no circumstances should the patient be sedated to allow for NIV.\n\nThe postdischarge therapy follows the same guidelines as for management by a general practitioner or pediatrician. Patients should be promptly and repeatedly evaluated by the physician providing treatment in the weeks following the exacerbation.\n\nFig. 7 Managementof asthmaexacerbations in emergency rooms\n\nPrimary prevention\n\nAsthma is a heterogeneous disease and ultimately the result of a gene-environment interaction. According to general consensus, there is a \"window of opportunity\" during pregnancy and early childhood, in which environmental factors can modify the development of asthma. GINA briefly addresses the most comprehensively studied factors, including breastfeeding, vitamin D, supplementary food, probiotics, inhaled allergens, tobacco smoke, microbial effects, drugs (antibiotics, paracetamol), as well as psychological aspects. At the end of the chapter, GINA provides a recommendation for generally applicable advice to parents regarding primary asthma prevention:\n\n● Avoid exposure to second-hand smoke, especially during pregnancy and in the child's first year of life.\n\n● Seek vaginal birth if possible.\n\n● Breastfeed (generally positive health effects).\n\n● Only use broad-spectrum antibiotics during pregnancy and in the child's first year of life if absolutely necessary.\n\nFor the other aforementioned factors, there are either insufficient data (or partly controversial) to give a general recommendation or the approaches are not generally applicable to everyone (e. g., growing up on a farm).\n\nPreschoolers\n\nFor the age group 0-5 years, there are significant differences in the entire asthma management from diagnosis to therapy [2]. Therefore this group is discussed in a separate section of the GINA Guidelines.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nThe possibility of a first manifestation in infants or toddlers makes diagnostic determination difficult in this age group because congenital disorders and a wide range of differential diagnostic possibilities (see Table 1) have to be taken into account and may need to be investigated along with perinatal aspects.\n\nA special feature in this age group is that many children suffer from asthma-like symptoms, while the number of children who are completely symptom-free in later life is very high. Children under 3 years of age commonly exhibit wheezing within the context of viral infections, and every third child suffers from episodic symptoms, frequently with excellent long-term prognosis. There are no reliable tests to distinguish between transient symptoms and true early childhood asthma - with the associated need for therapy.\n\nThe most significant indicators of early childhood asthma include:\n\n● Typical symptoms such as wheezing and coughing without an infection, also frequently during exertion/laughing/crying as well as reduced activity level and particularly nocturnal symptoms\n\n● Risk factors for asthma (especially positive family history of allergies or asthma)\n\n● Response to a therapy attempt with low-dose ICS and SABA on demand for 2-3months\n\nThe following additional examinations may be considered:\n\n● Allergy test: Reasonable because many children show relevant sensitization even under 3 years of age. For example, sensitivity to house-dust mites is associated with increased asthma risk.\n\n● Lung function diagnostics: Children usually have to be 5-6 years old before spirometry is possible, but it can be attempted earlier with sufficient expertise and time investment. The GINA Guidelines do not make any reference to alternative technologies (forced oscillation, impulse oscillometry, multiple-breath washout etc.). In addition, these techniques currently are only available in specialized centers.\n\n● Exhaled NO: Listed as a possible examination (tidal technique) in the GINA Guidelines, but not yet established for young children (apart from scientific applications). As soon as spirometry is possible, the forced expiratory flow maneuver can usually be employed in a defined flow range (\"single-breath\" method).\n\n● Further tests, mainly to rule out differential diagnoses: In addition to the lung X-ray specified in the GINA Guidelines, further examinations (bronchoscopy, sweat test, pH measurement etc.) may be required. However, they are not part of the primary diagnosis.\n\nTherapy and management\n\nAsthma control plays an important role, as in older children and adults. The GINA Guidelines offer a table on asthma control, which is similar to the table for older children and adults (see Table 2). It distinguis-\n\nFig. 8 Stepalgorithmof asthma therapy for children ≤5years\n\nhes between well-controlled, partly controlled, and uncontrolled asthma. In the case of young children, criteria are a little stricter (e. g., daily symptoms or SABA demand more than once a week compared with twice a week for older children; nocturnal cough is listed in addition to nocturnal awakening).\n\nPharmacological therapy\n\nPharmacological therapy follows a step algorithm, similar to older children, which is adapted to the age group (Fig. 8). An inhaled SABA on demand is the first choice in step 1; this on-demand therapy is recommended for all further therapy steps.\n\nIt is further recommended to refer the patient to a specialist from step 4 (if increasing the daily ICS dose does not lead to any improvement). Compared with previous guidelines, the administration of LTRA has declined in significance and is only recommended as an option. Current Austrian recommendations [7] also give preference to a primary therapy with low-dose ICS over an initial therapy with LTRA, since most of the children (especially those with allergies) benefit more from therapy with ICS. The GINAGuidelines also point out that oral administration of a beta-2-agonist is not recommended owing to the slower onset and higher rate of side effects.\n\nThe selection of the optimal inhaler for application of ICS and SABA is equally relevant for preschoolers because they can only properly inhale when breathing normally. The choice of inhaler is based on the child's age and ability. The preferred device for preschoolers is a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer and valve. It should have a mask for children under 4 years of age and a mouthpiece for most children from 4 years on. It is important to know that the administered medication dose may vary considerably among different spacers. Nebulizers can be used as an alternative for the few preschool children who cannot inhale effectively in spite of practicing with ametered dose inhaler with spacer.\n\nRegular re-evaluation and adjustment of the therapy is particularly important in this age group. Follow-up should occur within 3 months after every therapy modification.\n\nAsthma training and asthma plan\n\nAsthma training also makes sense for this age group. Emphasis should be on basic information about asthma, communicating the right inhalation technique and presenting a written asthma action plan (see also\n\n\"Asthma training and self-management\").\n\nThe onset of symptoms, severity, presence of differential diagnostic information, considerations concerning the inhalation technique, and, in many cases, inadequate therapeutic success frequently lead to the involvement of pediatric experts. This is highly relevant, since development-related aspects must be considered along with the fact that the absence of symptoms must be the objective of the treatment for this age group as well.\n\nConclusion\n\nGuidelines contribute to a standardized, uniform approach for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of major diseases. The GINA Guidelines have supported this effort in the area of asthma management for many years. New additions to the current guidelines include a differentiated definition of asthma that makes specific reference to the heterogeneous symptoms of the disease and no longer emphasizes bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The guidelines strongly encourage regular adaptation of the therapy regimen and the consistent reassessment of patients with different methods (clinical, lung function etc.). The role of ICS is highlighted in therapeutic aspects. These pharmaceuticals should be used at an early point in the course of the disease, preferably in low doses. ICS are now given priority over LTRA in the treatment of young children. At the highest treatment step, the concept of add-on therapy is recommended over an OCS therapy for adults. The guidelines again place particular emphasis on selecting the right inhaler and providing adequate asthma training. The implementation of the existing guidelines in routine treatment of asthma patients will be important for the future. Sufficient resources are necessary to enable training for private practitioners in hospitals as well as a comprehensive training program for asthma patients.\n\nOpen access funding provided by Paracelsus Medical University.\n\nConflict of interest F.

Introduction </p><p>Infections in the respiratory tract are very common but majority involve the upper respiratory system. Pneumonia is usually caused by inhalation of infecting organisms or the same may reach the lung via bloodstream. Pulmonary pathogens can cause tissue damage by a direct invasive cytolytic process or by releasing toxins (endotoxins and/or exotoxins). Acute inflammation may lead to complete resolution, destructive pneumonia with abscess formation, healing by fibrosis or chronic inflammation. Various infective agents causing pneumonia include viruses, bacteria, Mycobacteria, fungi, Chlamydiae, Mycoplasmas or parasites. </p><p>The diagnosis of various pulmonary infections is initially based on radiological evaluation depending upon chest X-ray, CT scan or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Cytological techniques used for detection of pulmonary infections include sputum examination, bronchial washing &amp; brushing, bronchoalveolar lavage, transbronchial/ transthoracic fine needle aspiration (FNA) and EUS (endoscopic ultrasonography) guided FNA. Transbronchial lung biopsies are performed for histopathological detection of various infections and for histological evidence of invasion. Tissue can be obtained by these techniques for culture or other molecular diagnostic techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Special stain most commonly used for bacteria is Gram's stain and for fungi are Gomori's methenamine silver (GMS), Gridley's fungus (GF), and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stains. </p><p>2. Viral infection </p><p>Various viruses implicated in viral pneumonia include influenza, parainflenza, adenovirus, coxsackie, echovirus, varicella, vaccinia and measles. Most viral pneumonias are mild, but may be more severe or may be complicated by secondary bacterial infection.1 Microscopically, there may be a diffuse pan-lobular pneumonia characterised by extensive proteinaceous exudative material in alveoli with alveolar wall thickening and infiltration by lymphocytes. Hyaline membranes can be formed lining the alveoli. There may be focal interstitial pneumonia. Cytomegalovirus infection is characterised by cytomegaly with a large eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion surrounded by a pale halo giving an owl's eye appearance.2 Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) pneumonia is characterized by intranuclear inclusions with nucleomegaly and basophilic ground-glass alterations in the nucleoplasm.3 </p><p>3. Bacterial infection </p><p>The bacterial infection in lung usually starts with the introduction of organisms into the airways. The routes by which bacteria can reach air spaces are inhalation of an aerosol, aspiration of respiratory or gastrointestinal secretions, or bacteraemic spread.4,5 The common bacilli include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, anaerobic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, enteric gram-negative bacilli, Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Legionelia spp. </p><p>This usually leads to acute inflammation characterized by sheets of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (figure 1), histiocytes, nuclear debris and necrosis which results in tissue destruction in the form of extensive necrotizing pneumonia with lung abscesses. Long-standing infection can lead to nonspecific chronic inflammation predominated by lymphocytes and histiocytes. Chronic pneumonia is most commonly caused by Mycobacteria and fungi. Actinomyces spp., Nocardia spp., and Pseudomonas pseudomallei can produce such infections. Legionnaire's disease is an acute respiratory infection caused by Legionella pneumophila, which stains best in tissue with a silver-based Dieterle stain rather than a Gram stain. Organising pneumonia is characterised by intra-alveolar proliferation of fibroblasts producing nodular structures called Masson bodies. </p><p>Fig. 1. Sheets of acute inflammatory cells in suppurative inflammation (MGG, 10X) </p><p>3.1 Granulomatous inflammation </p><p>Granulomatous Inflammation is characterized by collection of epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells. These epithelioid cells may have an elongated cone like shapes or may look like tiny carrots in sputum. These need to be differentiated from bronchial epithelial cells as these are elongated columnar cells which can mimic epithelioid cells.6 </p><p>Tuberculosis (TB) </p><p>TB can involve various organs but the most common organ involved is lung. TB is more common in the Third World/ developing countries and is much rarer in Western Europe and North America. Primary pulmonary TB usually affects the lower lobes of lung or the anterior segment of an upper lobe, known as the Ghon focus. Microscopically, there are caseating epithelioid granulomas with Langhan's type of multinucleated giant cells and lymphocytes (figure 2 &amp; 3).7 In tuberculosis, epithelioid histiocytes may be found in about 25% to 50% of sputum specimens.8 Mycobacteria are identified as elongated beaded acid-fast bacilli (AFB) by Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Auramine-rhodamine stain is another fluorescent dye used to identify these bacilli. Microbiological culture is done using Lowenstein-Jensen medium or Bactec culture. The necrotizing granulomas may be seen in fungal infections or Wegener's granulomatosis. Sarcoidosis is characterised by non-caseating epithelioid granulomas. Secondary pulmonary TB is usually due to re-infection and the lesion is almost always found in the subapical region of an upper lobe. Miliary TB results from seeding of the bacilli via the bloodstream. </p><p>Fig. 2. Epithelioid cell collection and lymphocytes forming a granuloma (MGG, 40X) </p><p> </p><p>Fig. 3. Epithelioid cell collections in a case of tuberculosis (H&amp;E, 40X) </p><p>4. Fungal infections </p><p>Fungi are eukaryotic, unicellular to multicellular, or filamentous organisms, that are ubiquitous in nature. The incidence of fungal infections is increased over the last two decades mostly because of increase in immunocompromised patients.9 The incidence of fungal infections in solid organ transplant recipients is between 5-42% and in bone marrow transplant recipients, the incidence ranges between 15-25% with Aspergillus, Cryptococcus and Candida being the most common fungal infections in these patients.10,11 </p><p>Fungi can elicit various types of tissue reactions such as acute inflammatory, necrosis, granulomatous inflammation. The ability to cause disease depends upon the virulence and the dose of the fungus, the route of infection, immunological status of the host and the organ affected. Lung is one of the most commonly affected organs by opportunistic fungal infections. Majority of the lung infections begin by inhalation of aerosolized fungi from the surrounding environment.12 The fungi causing invasive pulmonary infection can be primary and opportunistic type of fungi. The primary fungal infection occurs in healthy immunocompetent individuals and the opportunistic fungal infections are common in immunocompromised hosts. </p><p>4.1 Aspergillosis </p><p>The range of disease caused by fungi of the genus Aspergillus include- allergic bronchopulmonary disease, colonization of lung cavities/ intracavitory aspergilloma, chronic necrotizing bronchial aspergillosis (CNBA), chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis (CNPA) in mildly immunocompromised individuals and fulminant invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) with systemic involvement in severely immunocompromised patients.13,14 A fumigatus (most common), A flavus, A niger, and other Aspergillus spp. are the common species causing pulmonary infections.15 </p><p>Allergic pulmonary reactions occur due to hypersensitivity to Aspergillus antigens especially in patients of bronchial asthma. These include allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, chronic eosinophillic pneumonia, eosinophillic bronchiolitis, mucoid impaction of proximal bronchi or bronchocentric granulomatosis.16,17 On microscopy, there is an excess of eosinophillic infiltration with Charcot-Leyden crystals, mucus hypersecretion and destructive granulomatous inflammation with degenerated fungal hyphae.16 </p><p>Pulmonary aspergilloma or fungal/ mycotic ball is a compact mass of fungal hyphae colonizing pre-existing pulmonary cavity.14 The cavity may be due to tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, necrotic pulmonary malignancy, bronchiectasis or a bronchial cyst.18 Majority of the patients develop hemoptysis and the diagnosis is suspected after radiologic detection of thick walled pulmonary cavity with intracavitory mass and a positive serum precipitin reaction to Aspergillus antigen.19 </p><p>Chronic necrotizing bronchial aspergillosis (CNBA) includes superficial extensive infection of mucosal surface of bronchi resulting in mucosal erosion and ulceration with formation of pseudo-membranes. The patients usually present with wheezing, nonproductive cough and dyspnea. </p><p>Chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis (CNPA) is a progressive and destructive lesion in mildly immunocompromised individuals with non-cavitary structural lung disease such as sarcoidosis, chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, postradiation fibrosis, diabetes mellitus, tuberculosis, and pneumoconiosis etc. Majority of these patients have history of treatment with low-dose corticosteroids.20 Treatment includes surgical resection or antifungal therapy with drainage of the pulmonary cavity. </p><p>Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a fulminant infection in severely immunocompromised hosts. Vascular invasion is the hallmark of this condition and leads to thrombotic occlusion of arteries and veins. Chest X-ray shows patchy, multifocal or diffuse areas of consolidation, or wedge shaped pleura based infarct like infiltrates or miliary nodules.21 On microscopy, the nodular infarcts are composed of central ischemic necrosis, surrounded by fibrinous exudates and a peripheral zone of hemorrhage forming a target lesion. Fungal hyphae invade by radial growth and extend from a central occluded vessel. Occlusion of larger vessels lead to formation of wedge shaped pleura-based haemorrhagic infarcts. Disseminated systemic infection occurs in a quarter of patients with IPA involving gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, kidneys, heart, liver, spleen and thyroid gland.22 </p><p>On microscopic examination, the hyphae of the Aspergillus spp. are uniform, narrow (3-6µm in width), septate with regular, progressive and dichotomous branching usually at acute angles (45º angle) from the parent hyphae (figure 4). Conidiophores (fruiting bodies) are seen in lesions exposed to air such as pulmonary/ bronchial lesions. The fungal infection may result in necrotizing or granulomatous inflammation (figure 5) and sometimes is associated with Splendore- Hoeppli phenomenon. </p><p> </p><p>Fig. 4. A long septate hyphae with parallel cell walls of aspergillus in a necrotic background (MGG, 40X) </p><p>Fig. 5. Occasional hyphae of aspergillus in the multinucleated giant cell (MGG, 40X) </p><p>Differential diagnosis- The main differential diagnosis of Aspergillus includes zygomycetes, Pseudoallescheria boydii, the Fusarium spp. and occasionally Candida spp. </p><p>Treatment- Amphotericin B is the drug of choice followed by Itraconazole or Voriconazole. Localized infections or aspergilloma may be subjected to surgical excision. </p><p>4.2 Mucormycosis (Zygomycosis) </p><p>Mucormycosis is an opportunistic infection that occurs in immunocompromised hosts especially in patients with acute leukemia or lymphoma, patients treated with corticosteroids, cytotoxic drugs or antibiotic therapy or patients with relapse of an underlying pulmonary disease.23,24 The agents of mucormycosis include species within the genera Rhizopus, Absidia, Mucor, Rhizomucor, Saksenaea, Cunninghamella, Mortierella, Syncephalastrum, and Apophysomyces. These fungi are widely distributed and the infection is acquired by exposure to their sporangiospores. The patients usually present with fever and progressive pulmonary infiltrates. Chest X-ray usually shows patchy infiltrates, and single or multiple foci of consolidation.25 </p><p>On microscopic examination, the hyphae of mucormycosis are broad (6-25µm or more wide), delicate thin-walled, aseptate, pleomorphic with irregular non-parallel contours. The branching is often irregular arising at right angles to the parent hyphae. The hyphae are often wrinkled and folded upon themselves. The fungal infection is characterized by coagulative necrosis, neutrophilic infiltration and rarely granulomatous reaction. Angioinvasion leads to disseminated infection and ischemic necrotic lesions and infarcts. Amphotericin B is the drug of choice. </p><p>4.3 Cryptococcosis </p><p>Cryptococcosis starts as lung infection acquired by inhalation of the soil-inhabiting yeast, Crytococcus neoformans.26,27 The fungus is ubiquitous and is especially abundant in aviun, particularly pigeon excreta.28,29 Although the disease occurs in apparently healthy individuals, it is more often seen as an opportunistic infection especially in patients with haematologic malignancies, AIDS or patients with defective cellular immunity.30 </p><p>The pulmonary lesions include diffuse miliary lesions or patchy consolidation of mucoid nature, which is appreciable in freshly sectioned lungs. On microscopy, cryptococci are of variable size (5-15 •m in diameter) present both intra as well as extracellularly. These are ovoid, thin-walled, encapsulated organisms surrounded by a wide, clear capsule and have narrow-based budding (figure 6). This infection may be accompanied by little or no inflammation, a mixed inflammatory response or a granulomatous reaction. The capsule of these organisms is highlighted on PAS-AB (PAS- Alcain blue) or mucicarmine stains.31 Autofluorescence microscopy in Papanicolaou-stained smears gives auto fluorescence, which helps in rapid diagnosis of cryptococosis.32 Cryptococci should be differentiated from Blastomycosis, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Coccidiodes immitis. The combination of amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine is used for progressive pulmonary cryptococcosis. </p><p>4.4 Histoplasmosis </p><p>Histoplasmosis is a pulmonary disease caused by inhalation of airborne infectious conidia of the dimorphic fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum.33 Avian habitat like chicken </p><p> </p><p>Fig. 6. Extra cellular organisms of Cryptococcus; about 5-15 •m in diameter with budding (MGG, 100X) </p><p>coops, blackbird roosts, and caves, favor growth and multiplication of the fungus in soil rich in faecal matter. The clinical presentation depends upon the extent of exposure, presence of underlying pulmonary disease and the host immune status. Majority of the infections are asymptomatic. Symptomatic infection occurs in about 10-25% cases and these can be acute pulmonary disease, disseminated disease, chronic pulmonary disease and fibrosing mediastinitis. The confirmation of the recent or past infection is done by a positive reaction to the cutaneous test antigen histoplasmin. </p><p>Acute pulmonary disease </p><p>The patients may be asymptomatic or develop influenza-like symptoms after an incubation period of about 15 days. Pathologically, the lesion shows bronchopneumonia with neutrophilic infiltration, along with macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Granulomatous reaction with multinucleated giant cells occurs after two weeks followed by caseous necrosis.34 </p><p>Disseminated disease </p><p>Disseminated Histoplasmosis occurs in patients with defective cell mediated immunity and it leads to spread to infection to multiple organs. The patients present with fever with chills, productive cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, weight loss, headache, drowsiness, diarrhea, generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, purpura, and intestinal ulcerations. Chest X-ray usually reveals diffuse pulmonary interstitial infiltrates.35 The fungi may be associated with granulomatous reaction and the necrotic lesions may calcify. </p><p>Chronic pulmonary Histoplasmosis </p><p>Radiologically, the lesions can be infiltrative, cavitary, fibrosis with emphysema, and the residual solitary nodule or histoplasmoma (coin lesion).35 Other findings can be military calcification, pleural thickening, and enlarged hilar nodes. </p><p>Fibrosing mediastinitis </p><p>It is a benign condition comprising of fibrosis/ collagenization in mediastinum.36 The patients present with cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and pleurisy. Extensive fibrosis may lead to entrapment of heart or great vessels rarely. </p><p>The organisms are yeast like spherical or oval, uniform, 2- 4µm in diameter organisms, which reproduce by single budding (figure 7).37 The basophilic cytoplasm of the organism is retracted from rigid, thin, poorly stained cell wall, creating a halo/ clear space. The organisms are seen mainly within the macrophages. This may be associated with intense granulomatous reaction with caseation necrosis or calcification, which can mimic tuberculosis. The cell wall intensely stains with special stains especially Gomori methenamine silver stain. Gridley, PAS and Haematoxylin &amp; Eosin stains do not reliably demonstrate these organisms. </p><p>Fig. 7. Extracellular as well as intracellular round to oval, 2-4µm in size, budding yeasts of Histoplasma (MGG, 100X) </p><p>Differential diagnosis- The differential diagnosis of Histoplasma capsulatum includes Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida glabrata, Coccidiodes immitis, Blastomycosis dermatitidis and Leishmania amastigotes.37 </p><p>4.5 Blastomycosis </p><p>Blastomycosis is a systemic infection caused by the dimorphic fungus, Blastomyces dermatitidis. The infection is acquired by inhalation of airborne conidia of the mycelial form forming a pulmonary focus of infection. The pulmonary involvement can be acute or chronic. Acute pulmonary blastomycosis is usually a self-limited illness and the patient may remain asymptomatic or have non-specific symptoms varying from mild influenza-like symptoms to pneumonia. Chest X-ray shows patchy areas of consolidation with involvement of posterior segments of lower lobes of lungs in majority of the cases. The patients with chronic blastomycosis present with chronic respiratory symptoms such as chronic cough and chest pain persisting for weeks or months.38 Chest X-ray show linear lung infiltrates, mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules with cavitation mimicking tuberculosis.39 Multiple organ involvement occurs involving skin, bone and genitourinary tract. </p><p>The infection is acquired by inhalation of conidia from woody plant matter. The mold form is transformed into the yeast form in distal airways. In smears or tissue sections, the yeast is seen intra as well as extracellularly in macrophages and polymorphs. The organism may elicit acute abscess like reaction with neutrophilic infiltration to granulomatous reaction with epithelioid granulomas and multinucleated giant cells. The organisms are round to oval, 8-15µm in diameter with thick refractile double contoured walls and single broad based budding. The differential diagnosis includes H. capsulatum, Cryptococcus and Coccidioides immitis. </p><p>4.6 Coccidioidomycosis </p><p>It is caused by the dimorphic fungus, Coccidioides immitis. It is endemic in the southwest United States40 and north and central Mexico. Pulmonary infection is acquired by inhalation of airborne arthroconidia. The patients may remain asymptomatic or develop influenza-like illness, which is self-limiting. Chronic pneumonia, destructive fibro-cavitary disease or disseminated infection occurs in minority of the patients. Pulmonary lesions can be pneumonic, cavitary, nodulo-caesous and bronchiectatic.41 Pulmonary lesions are usually associated with acute suppurative or granulomatous inflammation. The organisms are thin-walled, mature spherules, 30-200µm in diameter (figure 8). Rupture of the spherules releases endospores into the surrounding tissue. The differential diagnosis includes sporangia of Rhinosporidium seeberi, budding yeast of Blastomyces dermatitidis or Histoplasma capsulatum. </p><p>4.7 Paracoccidioidomycosis (South American blastomycosis) </p><p>It is a chronic progressive lung infection caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and is endemic in South America. Pulmonary infection may be acute progressive with acute suppurative pneumonia or chronic progressive infection with granulomatous inflammation. The organisms are pleomorphic yeast like, 5-60µm in diameter, reproducing by budding. Yeast cells with fractured walls called mosaic cells are seen in chronic pulmonary lesions. The characteristic multiple budding cells give the appearance of a ship's steering wheel. The </p><p> </p><p>Fig. 8. Thin- walled (30-200µm in diameter) mature spherule of coccidiomycosis (MGG x20X) </p><p>blastoconidia produced by these cells can have an oval, tubular appearance or tear-drop blastoconidia attached to the parent cell by narrow necks. This needs to be differentiated from Histoplasma capsulatum. </p><p>4.8 Candidiasis </p><p>Candidiasis comprises of superficial, mucocutaneous, or systemic fungal infection caused by yeast like fungi of the genus Candida. Candida albicans is the most common type. Pulmonary involvement can be a) endobronchial/ primary pulmonary candidiasis acquired by aspiration of Candida spp. from oral cavity or upper respiratory tract, b) hematogenous pulmonary candidiasis and c) embolic pulmonary candidiasis in children with indwelling venous catheters.42,43 The lesions contain yeast forms and mycelial forms of Candida. The yeast-like cells are round to oval, 2-6µm in diameter, and have budding. The mycelia forms have both pseudohyphae and true septate branched hyphae. Pseudohyphae have periodic constrictions at the point where budding yeast cells are joined end to end. The inflammatory response to candida may vary from minimal inflammation to acute suppuration to granulomatous inflammation in chronic infections. The differential diagnosis includes B. dermatitidis, C. neoformans, H. capsulatum, and S. schenckii, the tissue forms of these consist of yeast forms. </p><p>4.9 Pneumocystis jeroveci </p><p>This is commonly seen in AIDS patients.44 Microscopically, the alveoli are usually filled with frothy, eosinophilic, PAS-positive coagulum in which the shadows of the non-staining cysts are seen. Grocott's Methenamine Silver (GMS) stain is used and the cell wall of the cyst stains black, often with a central dark dot. The cysts are 4 to 6 μm in diameter and spherical or cup/ sickle-shaped. Trophozoites may be up to 8 per cyst, are about 0.5 to 1.0μm in diameter and stain in Romanowsky (tiny purple dots). The diagnosis may be made on sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by demonstrating the cysts. </p><p>5. Bacterial infections that resemble fungal infections </p><p>5.1 Nocardiosis </p><p>Nocardiosis is a localized or disseminated infection caused by aerobic, filamentous, branching gram-positive bacteria.45 It is an uncommon infection in immunocompetent hosts. Pulmonary lesions may be large cavitating abscesses or diffuse fibrino-suppurative pneumonia. The smears or tissue sections show thin (about 1µm wide), filamentous, beaded bacilli branching at approximately right angles (figure 9).46 These are usually obscured by an intense acute necrotizing inflammation as they remain unstained on May-Grünwald Geimsa (MGG) stain, Haematoxylin or Eosin (H&amp;E) or PAS stains. The special stain used for its confirmation is a modified Ziehl- Neelsen stain using a weak decolorizing agent.47 The main differential diagnosis is Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Actinomycosis (figure 10). </p><p>Fig. 9. Multiple long thin filamentous structures (Nocardia) in an inflammatory background (Modified Ziehl- Neelsen stain, 100X). </p><p> </p><p>Fig. 10. Filamentous bacilli positive on Gram's stain of Actinomycosis (MGG x40X; Inset-Gram stain- 40X). </p><p>5.2 Botryomycosis (Bacterial pseudomycosis) </p><p>It is a chronic, localized infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue or various organs including lung and brain.48 It is caused by non-filamentous bacilli that form granules which include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli or Streptococci. Pulmonary lesions lead to acute suppurative abscesses with multiple granules which are bordered by eosinophillic, club-like Splendore-Hoeppli material. The differential diagnosis includes nocardiosis and actinomycosis. </p><p>6. Primary atypical pneumonia </p><p>Mycoplasma pneumoniae &amp; Chlamydiae are the important causes of primary atypical pneumonia. Mycoplasma can be stained by Giemsa but not by Gram's stain and the diagnosis is usually confirmed serologically. Microscopically, a prominent interstitial infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes and plasma cells is seen with interstitial oedema. </p><p>7.

Introduction\n\nInfections in the respiratory tract are very common but majority involve the upper respiratory system. Pneumonia is usually caused by inhalation of infecting organisms or the same may reach the lung via bloodstream. Pulmonary pathogens can cause tissue damage by a direct invasive cytolytic process or by releasing toxins (endotoxins and/or exotoxins). Acute inflammation may lead to complete resolution, destructive pneumonia with abscess formation, healing by fibrosis or chronic inflammation. Various infective agents causing pneumonia include viruses, bacteria, Mycobacteria, fungi, Chlamydiae, Mycoplasmas or parasites.\n\nThe diagnosis of various pulmonary infections is initially based on radiological evaluation depending upon chest X-ray, CT scan or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Cytological techniques used for detection of pulmonary infections include sputum examination, bronchial washing & brushing, bronchoalveolar lavage, transbronchial/ transthoracic fine needle aspiration (FNA) and EUS (endoscopic ultrasonography) guided FNA. Transbronchial lung biopsies are performed for histopathological detection of various infections and for histological evidence of invasion. Tissue can be obtained by these techniques for culture or other molecular diagnostic techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Special stain most commonly used for bacteria is Gram's stain and for fungi are Gomori's methenamine silver (GMS), Gridley's fungus (GF), and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stains.\n\n2. Viral infection\n\nVarious viruses implicated in viral pneumonia include influenza, parainflenza, adenovirus, coxsackie, echovirus, varicella, vaccinia and measles. Most viral pneumonias are mild, but may be more severe or may be complicated by secondary bacterial infection.1 Microscopically, there may be a diffuse pan-lobular pneumonia characterised by extensive proteinaceous exudative material in alveoli with alveolar wall thickening and infiltration by lymphocytes. Hyaline membranes can be formed lining the alveoli. There may be focal interstitial pneumonia. Cytomegalovirus infection is characterised by cytomegaly with a large eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion surrounded by a pale halo giving an owl's eye appearance.2 Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) pneumonia is characterized by intranuclear inclusions with nucleomegaly and basophilic ground-glass alterations in the nucleoplasm.3\n\n3. Bacterial infection\n\nThe bacterial infection in lung usually starts with the introduction of organisms into the airways. The routes by which bacteria can reach air spaces are inhalation of an aerosol, aspiration of respiratory or gastrointestinal secretions, or bacteraemic spread.4,5 The common bacilli include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, anaerobic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, enteric gram-negative bacilli, Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Legionelia spp.\n\nThis usually leads to acute inflammation characterized by sheets of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (figure 1), histiocytes, nuclear debris and necrosis which results in tissue destruction in the form of extensive necrotizing pneumonia with lung abscesses. Long-standing infection can lead to nonspecific chronic inflammation predominated by lymphocytes and histiocytes. Chronic pneumonia is most commonly caused by Mycobacteria and fungi. Actinomyces spp., Nocardia spp., and Pseudomonas pseudomallei can produce such infections. Legionnaire's disease is an acute respiratory infection caused by Legionella pneumophila, which stains best in tissue with a silver-based Dieterle stain rather than a Gram stain. Organising pneumonia is characterised by intra-alveolar proliferation of fibroblasts producing nodular structures called Masson bodies.\n\nFig. 1. Sheets of acute inflammatory cells in suppurative inflammation (MGG, 10X)\n\n3.1 Granulomatous inflammation\n\nGranulomatous Inflammation is characterized by collection of epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells. These epithelioid cells may have an elongated cone like shapes or may look like tiny carrots in sputum. These need to be differentiated from bronchial epithelial cells as these are elongated columnar cells which can mimic epithelioid cells.6\n\nTuberculosis (TB)\n\nTB can involve various organs but the most common organ involved is lung. TB is more common in the Third World/ developing countries and is much rarer in Western Europe and North America. Primary pulmonary TB usually affects the lower lobes of lung or the anterior segment of an upper lobe, known as the Ghon focus. Microscopically, there are caseating epithelioid granulomas with Langhan's type of multinucleated giant cells and lymphocytes (figure 2 & 3).7 In tuberculosis, epithelioid histiocytes may be found in about 25% to 50% of sputum specimens.8 Mycobacteria are identified as elongated beaded acid-fast bacilli (AFB) by Ziehl-Neelsen staining. Auramine-rhodamine stain is another fluorescent dye used to identify these bacilli. Microbiological culture is done using Lowenstein-Jensen medium or Bactec culture. The necrotizing granulomas may be seen in fungal infections or Wegener's granulomatosis. Sarcoidosis is characterised by non-caseating epithelioid granulomas. Secondary pulmonary TB is usually due to re-infection and the lesion is almost always found in the subapical region of an upper lobe. Miliary TB results from seeding of the bacilli via the bloodstream.\n\nFig. 2. Epithelioid cell collection and lymphocytes forming a granuloma (MGG, 40X)\n\nFig. 3. Epithelioid cell collections in a case of tuberculosis (H&E, 40X)\n\n4. Fungal infections\n\nFungi are eukaryotic, unicellular to multicellular, or filamentous organisms, that are ubiquitous in nature. The incidence of fungal infections is increased over the last two decades mostly because of increase in immunocompromised patients.9 The incidence of fungal infections in solid organ transplant recipients is between 5-42% and in bone marrow transplant recipients, the incidence ranges between 15-25% with Aspergillus, Cryptococcus and Candida being the most common fungal infections in these patients.10,11\n\nFungi can elicit various types of tissue reactions such as acute inflammatory, necrosis, granulomatous inflammation. The ability to cause disease depends upon the virulence and the dose of the fungus, the route of infection, immunological status of the host and the organ affected. Lung is one of the most commonly affected organs by opportunistic fungal infections. Majority of the lung infections begin by inhalation of aerosolized fungi from the surrounding environment.12 The fungi causing invasive pulmonary infection can be primary and opportunistic type of fungi. The primary fungal infection occurs in healthy immunocompetent individuals and the opportunistic fungal infections are common in immunocompromised hosts.\n\n4.1 Aspergillosis\n\nThe range of disease caused by fungi of the genus Aspergillus include- allergic bronchopulmonary disease, colonization of lung cavities/ intracavitory aspergilloma, chronic necrotizing bronchial aspergillosis (CNBA), chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis (CNPA) in mildly immunocompromised individuals and fulminant invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) with systemic involvement in severely immunocompromised patients.13,14 A fumigatus (most common), A flavus, A niger, and other Aspergillus spp. are the common species causing pulmonary infections.15\n\nAllergic pulmonary reactions occur due to hypersensitivity to Aspergillus antigens especially in patients of bronchial asthma. These include allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, chronic eosinophillic pneumonia, eosinophillic bronchiolitis, mucoid impaction of proximal bronchi or bronchocentric granulomatosis.16,17 On microscopy, there is an excess of eosinophillic infiltration with Charcot-Leyden crystals, mucus hypersecretion and destructive granulomatous inflammation with degenerated fungal hyphae.16\n\nPulmonary aspergilloma or fungal/ mycotic ball is a compact mass of fungal hyphae colonizing pre-existing pulmonary cavity.14 The cavity may be due to tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, necrotic pulmonary malignancy, bronchiectasis or a bronchial cyst.18 Majority of the patients develop hemoptysis and the diagnosis is suspected after radiologic detection of thick walled pulmonary cavity with intracavitory mass and a positive serum precipitin reaction to Aspergillus antigen.19\n\nChronic necrotizing bronchial aspergillosis (CNBA) includes superficial extensive infection of mucosal surface of bronchi resulting in mucosal erosion and ulceration with formation of pseudo-membranes. The patients usually present with wheezing, nonproductive cough and dyspnea.\n\nChronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis (CNPA) is a progressive and destructive lesion in mildly immunocompromised individuals with non-cavitary structural lung disease such as sarcoidosis, chronic pulmonary obstructive disease, postradiation fibrosis, diabetes mellitus, tuberculosis, and pneumoconiosis etc. Majority of these patients have history of treatment with low-dose corticosteroids.20 Treatment includes surgical resection or antifungal therapy with drainage of the pulmonary cavity.\n\nInvasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a fulminant infection in severely immunocompromised hosts. Vascular invasion is the hallmark of this condition and leads to thrombotic occlusion of arteries and veins. Chest X-ray shows patchy, multifocal or diffuse areas of consolidation, or wedge shaped pleura based infarct like infiltrates or miliary nodules.21 On microscopy, the nodular infarcts are composed of central ischemic necrosis, surrounded by fibrinous exudates and a peripheral zone of hemorrhage forming a target lesion. Fungal hyphae invade by radial growth and extend from a central occluded vessel. Occlusion of larger vessels lead to formation of wedge shaped pleura-based haemorrhagic infarcts. Disseminated systemic infection occurs in a quarter of patients with IPA involving gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, kidneys, heart, liver, spleen and thyroid gland.22\n\nOn microscopic examination, the hyphae of the Aspergillus spp. are uniform, narrow (3-6µm in width), septate with regular, progressive and dichotomous branching usually at acute angles (45º angle) from the parent hyphae (figure 4). Conidiophores (fruiting bodies) are seen in lesions exposed to air such as pulmonary/ bronchial lesions. The fungal infection may result in necrotizing or granulomatous inflammation (figure 5) and sometimes is associated with Splendore- Hoeppli phenomenon.\n\nFig. 4. A long septate hyphae with parallel cell walls of aspergillus in a necrotic background (MGG, 40X)\n\nFig. 5. Occasional hyphae of aspergillus in the multinucleated giant cell (MGG, 40X)\n\nDifferential diagnosis- The main differential diagnosis of Aspergillus includes zygomycetes, Pseudoallescheria boydii, the Fusarium spp. and occasionally Candida spp.\n\nTreatment- Amphotericin B is the drug of choice followed by Itraconazole or Voriconazole. Localized infections or aspergilloma may be subjected to surgical excision.\n\n4.2 Mucormycosis (Zygomycosis)\n\nMucormycosis is an opportunistic infection that occurs in immunocompromised hosts especially in patients with acute leukemia or lymphoma, patients treated with corticosteroids, cytotoxic drugs or antibiotic therapy or patients with relapse of an underlying pulmonary disease.23,24 The agents of mucormycosis include species within the genera Rhizopus, Absidia, Mucor, Rhizomucor, Saksenaea, Cunninghamella, Mortierella, Syncephalastrum, and Apophysomyces. These fungi are widely distributed and the infection is acquired by exposure to their sporangiospores. The patients usually present with fever and progressive pulmonary infiltrates. Chest X-ray usually shows patchy infiltrates, and single or multiple foci of consolidation.25\n\nOn microscopic examination, the hyphae of mucormycosis are broad (6-25µm or more wide), delicate thin-walled, aseptate, pleomorphic with irregular non-parallel contours. The branching is often irregular arising at right angles to the parent hyphae. The hyphae are often wrinkled and folded upon themselves. The fungal infection is characterized by coagulative necrosis, neutrophilic infiltration and rarely granulomatous reaction. Angioinvasion leads to disseminated infection and ischemic necrotic lesions and infarcts. Amphotericin B is the drug of choice.\n\n4.3 Cryptococcosis\n\nCryptococcosis starts as lung infection acquired by inhalation of the soil-inhabiting yeast, Crytococcus neoformans.26,27 The fungus is ubiquitous and is especially abundant in aviun, particularly pigeon excreta.28,29 Although the disease occurs in apparently healthy individuals, it is more often seen as an opportunistic infection especially in patients with haematologic malignancies, AIDS or patients with defective cellular immunity.30\n\nThe pulmonary lesions include diffuse miliary lesions or patchy consolidation of mucoid nature, which is appreciable in freshly sectioned lungs. On microscopy, cryptococci are of variable size (5-15 •m in diameter) present both intra as well as extracellularly. These are ovoid, thin-walled, encapsulated organisms surrounded by a wide, clear capsule and have narrow-based budding (figure 6). This infection may be accompanied by little or no inflammation, a mixed inflammatory response or a granulomatous reaction. The capsule of these organisms is highlighted on PAS-AB (PAS- Alcain blue) or mucicarmine stains.31 Autofluorescence microscopy in Papanicolaou-stained smears gives auto fluorescence, which helps in rapid diagnosis of cryptococosis.32 Cryptococci should be differentiated from Blastomycosis, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Coccidiodes immitis. The combination of amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine is used for progressive pulmonary cryptococcosis.\n\n4.4 Histoplasmosis\n\nHistoplasmosis is a pulmonary disease caused by inhalation of airborne infectious conidia of the dimorphic fungus, Histoplasma capsulatum var. capsulatum.33 Avian habitat like chicken\n\nFig. 6. Extra cellular organisms of Cryptococcus; about 5-15 •m in diameter with budding (MGG, 100X)\n\ncoops, blackbird roosts, and caves, favor growth and multiplication of the fungus in soil rich in faecal matter. The clinical presentation depends upon the extent of exposure, presence of underlying pulmonary disease and the host immune status. Majority of the infections are asymptomatic. Symptomatic infection occurs in about 10-25% cases and these can be acute pulmonary disease, disseminated disease, chronic pulmonary disease and fibrosing mediastinitis. The confirmation of the recent or past infection is done by a positive reaction to the cutaneous test antigen histoplasmin.\n\nAcute pulmonary disease\n\nThe patients may be asymptomatic or develop influenza-like symptoms after an incubation period of about 15 days. Pathologically, the lesion shows bronchopneumonia with neutrophilic infiltration, along with macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Granulomatous reaction with multinucleated giant cells occurs after two weeks followed by caseous necrosis.34\n\nDisseminated disease\n\nDisseminated Histoplasmosis occurs in patients with defective cell mediated immunity and it leads to spread to infection to multiple organs. The patients present with fever with chills, productive cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, weight loss, headache, drowsiness, diarrhea, generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, purpura, and intestinal ulcerations. Chest X-ray usually reveals diffuse pulmonary interstitial infiltrates.35 The fungi may be associated with granulomatous reaction and the necrotic lesions may calcify.\n\nChronic pulmonary Histoplasmosis\n\nRadiologically, the lesions can be infiltrative, cavitary, fibrosis with emphysema, and the residual solitary nodule or histoplasmoma (coin lesion).35 Other findings can be military calcification, pleural thickening, and enlarged hilar nodes.\n\nFibrosing mediastinitis\n\nIt is a benign condition comprising of fibrosis/ collagenization in mediastinum.36 The patients present with cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and pleurisy. Extensive fibrosis may lead to entrapment of heart or great vessels rarely.\n\nThe organisms are yeast like spherical or oval, uniform, 2- 4µm in diameter organisms, which reproduce by single budding (figure 7).37 The basophilic cytoplasm of the organism is retracted from rigid, thin, poorly stained cell wall, creating a halo/ clear space. The organisms are seen mainly within the macrophages. This may be associated with intense granulomatous reaction with caseation necrosis or calcification, which can mimic tuberculosis. The cell wall intensely stains with special stains especially Gomori methenamine silver stain. Gridley, PAS and Haematoxylin & Eosin stains do not reliably demonstrate these organisms.\n\nFig. 7. Extracellular as well as intracellular round to oval, 2-4µm in size, budding yeasts of Histoplasma (MGG, 100X)\n\nDifferential diagnosis- The differential diagnosis of Histoplasma capsulatum includes Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida glabrata, Coccidiodes immitis, Blastomycosis dermatitidis and Leishmania amastigotes.37\n\n4.5 Blastomycosis\n\nBlastomycosis is a systemic infection caused by the dimorphic fungus, Blastomyces dermatitidis. The infection is acquired by inhalation of airborne conidia of the mycelial form forming a pulmonary focus of infection. The pulmonary involvement can be acute or chronic. Acute pulmonary blastomycosis is usually a self-limited illness and the patient may remain asymptomatic or have non-specific symptoms varying from mild influenza-like symptoms to pneumonia. Chest X-ray shows patchy areas of consolidation with involvement of posterior segments of lower lobes of lungs in majority of the cases. The patients with chronic blastomycosis present with chronic respiratory symptoms such as chronic cough and chest pain persisting for weeks or months.38 Chest X-ray show linear lung infiltrates, mediastinal lymphadenopathy and pulmonary nodules with cavitation mimicking tuberculosis.39 Multiple organ involvement occurs involving skin, bone and genitourinary tract.\n\nThe infection is acquired by inhalation of conidia from woody plant matter. The mold form is transformed into the yeast form in distal airways. In smears or tissue sections, the yeast is seen intra as well as extracellularly in macrophages and polymorphs. The organism may elicit acute abscess like reaction with neutrophilic infiltration to granulomatous reaction with epithelioid granulomas and multinucleated giant cells. The organisms are round to oval, 8-15µm in diameter with thick refractile double contoured walls and single broad based budding. The differential diagnosis includes H. capsulatum, Cryptococcus and Coccidioides immitis.\n\n4.6 Coccidioidomycosis\n\nIt is caused by the dimorphic fungus, Coccidioides immitis. It is endemic in the southwest United States40 and north and central Mexico. Pulmonary infection is acquired by inhalation of airborne arthroconidia. The patients may remain asymptomatic or develop influenza-like illness, which is self-limiting. Chronic pneumonia, destructive fibro-cavitary disease or disseminated infection occurs in minority of the patients. Pulmonary lesions can be pneumonic, cavitary, nodulo-caesous and bronchiectatic.41 Pulmonary lesions are usually associated with acute suppurative or granulomatous inflammation. The organisms are thin-walled, mature spherules, 30-200µm in diameter (figure 8). Rupture of the spherules releases endospores into the surrounding tissue. The differential diagnosis includes sporangia of Rhinosporidium seeberi, budding yeast of Blastomyces dermatitidis or Histoplasma capsulatum.\n\n4.7 Paracoccidioidomycosis (South American blastomycosis)\n\nIt is a chronic progressive lung infection caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and is endemic in South America. Pulmonary infection may be acute progressive with acute suppurative pneumonia or chronic progressive infection with granulomatous inflammation. The organisms are pleomorphic yeast like, 5-60µm in diameter, reproducing by budding. Yeast cells with fractured walls called mosaic cells are seen in chronic pulmonary lesions. The characteristic multiple budding cells give the appearance of a ship's steering wheel. The\n\nFig. 8. Thin- walled (30-200µm in diameter) mature spherule of coccidiomycosis (MGG x20X)\n\nblastoconidia produced by these cells can have an oval, tubular appearance or tear-drop blastoconidia attached to the parent cell by narrow necks. This needs to be differentiated from Histoplasma capsulatum.\n\n4.8 Candidiasis\n\nCandidiasis comprises of superficial, mucocutaneous, or systemic fungal infection caused by yeast like fungi of the genus Candida. Candida albicans is the most common type. Pulmonary involvement can be a) endobronchial/ primary pulmonary candidiasis acquired by aspiration of Candida spp. from oral cavity or upper respiratory tract, b) hematogenous pulmonary candidiasis and c) embolic pulmonary candidiasis in children with indwelling venous catheters.42,43 The lesions contain yeast forms and mycelial forms of Candida. The yeast-like cells are round to oval, 2-6µm in diameter, and have budding. The mycelia forms have both pseudohyphae and true septate branched hyphae. Pseudohyphae have periodic constrictions at the point where budding yeast cells are joined end to end. The inflammatory response to candida may vary from minimal inflammation to acute suppuration to granulomatous inflammation in chronic infections. The differential diagnosis includes B. dermatitidis, C. neoformans, H. capsulatum, and S. schenckii, the tissue forms of these consist of yeast forms.\n\n4.9 Pneumocystis jeroveci\n\nThis is commonly seen in AIDS patients.44 Microscopically, the alveoli are usually filled with frothy, eosinophilic, PAS-positive coagulum in which the shadows of the non-staining cysts are seen. Grocott's Methenamine Silver (GMS) stain is used and the cell wall of the cyst stains black, often with a central dark dot. The cysts are 4 to 6 μm in diameter and spherical or cup/ sickle-shaped. Trophozoites may be up to 8 per cyst, are about 0.5 to 1.0μm in diameter and stain in Romanowsky (tiny purple dots). The diagnosis may be made on sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by demonstrating the cysts.\n\n5. Bacterial infections that resemble fungal infections\n\n5.1 Nocardiosis\n\nNocardiosis is a localized or disseminated infection caused by aerobic, filamentous, branching gram-positive bacteria.45 It is an uncommon infection in immunocompetent hosts. Pulmonary lesions may be large cavitating abscesses or diffuse fibrino-suppurative pneumonia. The smears or tissue sections show thin (about 1µm wide), filamentous, beaded bacilli branching at approximately right angles (figure 9).46 These are usually obscured by an intense acute necrotizing inflammation as they remain unstained on May-Grünwald Geimsa (MGG) stain, Haematoxylin or Eosin (H&E) or PAS stains. The special stain used for its confirmation is a modified Ziehl- Neelsen stain using a weak decolorizing agent.47 The main differential diagnosis is Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Actinomycosis (figure 10).\n\nFig. 9. Multiple long thin filamentous structures (Nocardia) in an inflammatory background (Modified Ziehl- Neelsen stain, 100X).\n\nFig. 10. Filamentous bacilli positive on Gram's stain of Actinomycosis (MGG x40X; Inset-Gram stain- 40X).\n\n5.2 Botryomycosis (Bacterial pseudomycosis)\n\nIt is a chronic, localized infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue or various organs including lung and brain.48 It is caused by non-filamentous bacilli that form granules which include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli or Streptococci. Pulmonary lesions lead to acute suppurative abscesses with multiple granules which are bordered by eosinophillic, club-like Splendore-Hoeppli material. The differential diagnosis includes nocardiosis and actinomycosis.\n\n6. Primary atypical pneumonia\n\nMycoplasma pneumoniae & Chlamydiae are the important causes of primary atypical pneumonia. Mycoplasma can be stained by Giemsa but not by Gram's stain and the diagnosis is usually confirmed serologically. Microscopically, a prominent interstitial infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes and plasma cells is seen with interstitial oedema.\n\n7.

Caused by bacteria,viruses or fungi, respiratory infections require distinct knowledge of recent advances in pathogenesis. Progressin the understanding of immunopathogenesis of Acinetobacter baumannii infection will explain how an atypicalorganism establishes infection. The chapter regarding pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infections inthe State of Para depicts a unique study in an endemic region for tuberculosis in North of Brazil. The diagnosisand treatment of latent tuberculosis is a formidable challenge. Thus, new developments in diagnosis andtreatment of latent tuberculosis are included in this book. Challenging in their diagnosis, nontuberculousmycobacterial pulmonary diseases require special education for management. The problems of respiratoryinfections in the immunocompromised host are increasing in numbers and in resilience to treatment.Therefore, the chapter describing the host immune responses against pulmonary fungal pathogens comes asa necessary section in this book. The insight brought forth from this book can be valuable for both cliniciansand scientists.\n\nHow to reference\n\nIn order to correctly reference this scholarly work, feel free to copy and paste the following:\n\nNalini Gupta and Arvind Rajwanshi (2012).

Introduction </p><p>The lungs are a gateway for numerous airborne pathogens that are ubiquitous in our environment. Among these potential pathogens are fungi that can be found in the soil, bird excreta, air ducts, and many other places where their contact is unavoidable. Exposure to these fungal pathogens oftentimes goes unnoticed due to the activation of our robust immune systems which sequester and control these microbes before significant damage occurs. Still, there are many situations in which host immunity becomes compromised providing an opportunity for typically innocuous fungal organisms to become established and cause disease or for dormant infections to reawaken. Also, in certain cases disease may be exacerbated due to an over exuberant immune response. In this chapter, we will review the main aspects of innate and adaptive immune responses against pulmonary fungal pathogens. We will also discuss the potential for vaccines to prevent pulmonary fungal infections. </p><p>2. Introduction to pulmonary fungal infections </p><p>Pulmonary fungal infections can be grouped into primary fungal pathogens and opportunistic fungal pathogens. Those organisms that can cause disease in immune competent hosts are considered primary pathogens including Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, Paracoccidioides brasilensis, and Blastomyces dermatiditis. All of the primary pulmonary fungal pathogens are endemic to the United States and/or Central &amp; South America. Histoplasma and Blastomyces are endemic to the Ohio River &amp; Mississippi River Valleys of the United States and also to certain regions of Central and South America (Klein et al., 1986; Deepe, 2000). Coccidioides is prevalent in the desert southwest United States (Fisher et al., 2007), and Paracoccidioides is endemic in Central and South America, particularly in Brazil (Franco, 1987; Franco et al., 1989; Brummer et al., 1993). These </p><p>* Corresponding Author infections are acquired by inhalation of fungi from contaminated soil, and severity of disease generally correlates with the amount of exposure to the pathogen. </p><p>Examples of organisms that are opportunistic pulmonary fungal pathogens include Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Pneumocystis, and Rhizopus. C. neoformans is found ubiquitously in the soil, usually in soil contaminated with pigeon guano (Perfect and Casadevall, 2002). These fungi primarily cause disease in individuals with compromised immune systems. Most cryptococcal infections are asymptomatic, and the organism typically causes disease in immune compromised patients, such as AIDS patients, solid organ transplant patients on immune-suppressive drugs, or patients receiving chemotherapy (Levitz, 1991; Mitchell and Perfect, 1995; Singh et al., 1997; Shoham and Levitz, 2005). A. fumigatus is ubiquitously found in the environment, and is normally found in association with decaying wood and plant matter (Deacon et al., 2009). However, A. fumigatus can cause severe respiratory infections in cases of massive exposure or immune deficiency, such as neutropenia, due to chemotherapy, AIDS, or bone marrow transplant therapy (Denning, 1996; Almyroudis et al., 2005; Magill et al., 2008). Pneumocystis infection is acquired by inhalation of organisms from a yet unknown source (Keely et al., 1995; reviewed in Kelly and Shellito, 2010). Most Pneumocystis infections occur in immunosuppressed individuals due to either HIV or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Leigh et al., 1993; Nevez et al., 1999; Huang et al., 2003; Calderon et al., 1996; Morris et al., 2004; Norris et al., 2006; Davis et al., 2008; Morris et al., 2008a; Morris et al., 2008b; Kling et al., 2009). Similarly, infection with Rhizopus typically occurs in individuals who are immune compromised, such as organ transplant recipients (Kontoyiannis, 2010; Pappas et al., 2010). </p><p>3. Innate immune responses against pulmonary fungal pathogens </p><p>3.1 Phagocyte interactions with pulmonary fungal pathogens </p><p>Cells of the innate immune system such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages residing in the lungs/airways are the first line of defense against pulmonary fungal pathogens. Although these innate cells cannot completely eliminate many fungal pathogens, they are involved in uptake and degradation of fungi and processing of antigens derived from these pathogens. In contrast, neutrophils which are also phagocytic and can be fungistatic are unable to present antigen. Based on the subset of receptors involved and signaling pathways triggered by these receptors, the innate immune system will trigger different types of early responses and subsequently translate these signals to mount different types of adaptive responses. </p><p>H. capsulatum can initially be engulfed by macrophages, DCs, and neutrophils (reviewed in (Deepe, 2005)), however, H. capsulatum recognition by different receptors results in different fates (Gomez et al., 2008). DCs recognize H. capsulatum by VLA-5, by interaction with an unknown receptor, which results in uptake, killing, and antigen presentation (Gildea et al., 2001; Gomez et al., 2008). Human DCs exert their antifungal activity via phagolysosomal fusion. The addition of suramin (which blocks phagolysosomal fusion) inhibits DC fungicidal activity, but inhibition of lysosomal acidification and inhibition of respiratory burst has no effect (Gildea et al., 2005). In contrast to DCs, macrophages recognize the H. capsulatum surface molecule heat-shock protein 60 (HSP 60) by LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18), complement receptor 3 (CD11b/CD18), and complement receptor 4 (CD11c/CD18) and this recognition leads to uptake and intracellular replication (Kimberlin et al., 1981; Bullock and Wright, 1987; Long et al., 2003; Gomez et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2010). However, activated macrophages can halt intracellular replication (Wu-Hsieh and Howard, 1984; Wu-Hsieh et al., 1984). H. capsulatum can avoid the macrophage lysosomal environment by preventing phagolysosomal fusion (Newman et al., 1997; Strasser et al., 1999) or by alkalinizing the pH of the phagolysosome (Eissenberg and Goldman, 1988; Eissenberg et al., 1988; Eissenberg et al., 1993). Macrophages infected with H. capsulatum and activated with GM-CSF decrease available iron and zinc, while infected macrophages without GM-CSF do not. Further, chelation of zinc inhibits yeast replication; therefore zinc deprivation may be used by macrophages in host defense against H. capsulatum (Winters et al., 2010). Neutrophil phagocytosis of H. capsulatum requires opsonization with either antibody or complement (Brummer et al., 1991; Kurita et al., 1991a; Kurita et al., 1991b; Newman et al., 1993). Neutrophil uptake of H. capsulatum is fungistatic, as opposed to macrophages (permissive growth &amp; replication) and DCs (fungicidal) (reviewed in Deepe, 2005). A lack of neutrophils causes a non-lethal infection to become a lethal infection (Zhou et al., 1998). </p><p>Immature DCs bind spherules of Coccidioides in a time and temperature-dependent manner, and binding is blocked by mannan, suggesting that mannose receptor (MR) is involved in this interaction (Dionne et al., 2006). Spherules of Coccidioides stimulate DC functional maturation, evidenced by decreased endocytic capacity and stimulation of allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cell activation (Dionne et al., 2006). Further studies showed that a DC-based Coccidioides vaccine had adjuvant properties and activated protective immune responses in mice (Awasthi, 2007). Although macrophages can ingest Coccidioides; earlier studies suggested that they are not able to kill the arthroconidia (Kashkin et al., 1977; Beaman et al., 1981, 1983; Beaman and Holmberg, 1980b, 1980a). Studies demonstrated that monocytes derived from human peripheral blood were able to kill Coccidioides (Ampel and Galgiani, 1991). Neutrophils are the earliest cell type to infiltrate upon pulmonary infection with Coccidioides arthroconidia (Savage and Madin, 1968). Phagocytosis by neutrophils is enhanced by the addition of immune serum (Drutz and Huppert, 1983; Wegner et al., 1972; Frey and Drutz, 1986). Uptake of Coccidioides arthroconidia by neutrophils induces a respiratory burst (Frey and Drutz, 1986), but less than 20% of the arthroconidia are killed (Frey and Drutz, 1986; Beaman and Holmberg, 1980b; Drutz and Huppert, 1983). The spherule form of Coccidioides cannot be phagocytosed by or killed by neutrophils (Frey and Drutz, 1986; Galgiani, 1986), but rupture of the spherule leads to an influx of neutrophils (Frey and Drutz, 1986). </p><p>P. brasiliensis can be phagocytosed by immature DCs, and uptake is significantly decreased with the addition of mannan, suggesting that MR is the primary receptor for P. brasiliensis on DCs (Ferreira et al., 2004). After DC uptake of P. brasiliensis, the fungal organisms survive and multiply intracellularly rather than being killed (Ferreira et al., 2004). Following in vitro culture of P. brasiliensis or the major surface antigen gp43 with DCs, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II is downregulated as is the production of interleukin (IL)-12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-• (Ferreira et al., 2004). However, in vivo studies showed that DC interaction with P. brasiliensis results in modification of DC receptor expression, including upregulation of CCR7, CD103, and MHC II and also induces migration of both pulmonary and bone marrow-derived DCs. DCs are also able to activate T helper cell responses in the draining lymph nodes following interaction with P. brasiliensis (Silvana dos Santos et al., 2011). Alveolar macrophages adhere to and internalize Paracoccidioides using the organism's phospholipase B, which also serves to downregulate macrophage activation (Soares et al., 2010). During pulmonary infection with P. brasiliensis, a shift in macrophage activation occurs, which is characterized by an increase in IL-1, TNF-•, and IL-6 (Silva et al., 2011). P. brasilensis can proliferate within macrophages, but macrophage activation inhibits its growth (Brummer et al., 1988; Cano et al., 1994). Further, macrophages activated by interferon (IFN)-• can kill P. brasiliensis (Cano et al., 1994; Gonzalez et al., 2000). In vitro stimulation of human monocytes and neutrophils with Paracoccidiodes yeast showed downregulation of toll-like receptor (TLR)2, TLR4, and dectin-1 on the surface of these cells. In addition, yeast cells induced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-• (Bonfim et al., 2009). Mice lacking TLR2 had a less severe pulmonary infection than wild-type (WT) mice and had decreased nitric oxide (NO) production. However, despite the differences in infection, both TLR2-/- mice and WT mice had similar rates of survival and similar pulmonary inflammatory responses (Loures et al., 2009). Further, TLR2 deficiency skewed the adaptive response towards a T helper (Th)17 phenotype and caused a decrease in T regulatory cells. Increased neutrophils and eosinophils migrate to the lungs of mice susceptible to P. brasiliensis, (Cano et al., 1995), and this influx affects the disease outcome and the adaptive response induced to infection. In susceptible individuals recovered from Paracoccidiodes, neutrophils are able to phagocytose the organism, but this leads to degeneration of the neutrophils. These data suggest that susceptible individuals have an inherent neutrophil deficiency (Dias et al., 2008). Further, neutrophils from patients with P. brasiliensis have a digestive defect against the fungus (Goihman-Yahr et al., 1980), and also have a killing defect against the fungus (Goihman-Yahr et al., 1985; Goihman-Yahr et al., 1992). </p><p>B. dermatiditis interaction with DCs causes efficient upregulation of antigen presentation and costimulatory molecules and induces production of IL-12 and TNF-• (Wuthrich et al., 2006). DCs can activate CD8+ T cells in the absence of CD4+ T cells, and the yeast alone is a sufficient inflammatory stimulus that can directly induce maturation of DCs and can induce production of TNF-•, IL-1•, and IL-12 (Wuthrich et al., 2006). Monocyte-derived dendritic cells can associate with yeast in the lung and transport them to the draining lymph nodes, but fail to present antigen to CD4+ T cells, however dermal DCs are capable of antigen presentation (Ersland et al., 2010). During B. dermatiditis infection, alveolar macrophages are only modestly able to ingest and kill the yeast form of the organism (Bradsher et al., 1987). Murine macrophages are only able to kill less than 5% of yeast (Brummer and Stevens, 1987; Brummer et al., 1988), and had a 25-30% reduction in respiratory burst compared to the respiratory burst induced by zymosan. The Blastomyces adhesion 1 (BAD1) molecule on the Blastomyces yeast surface is responsible for binding to CD11b/CD18 and CD14 on the macrophage surface and subsequent entry (Klein et al., 1993; Newman et al., 1995). Neutrophils rapidly infiltrate to pulmonary tissues following infection, and are responsible for the formation of pyogranulomatous lesions. Conidia are rapidly phagocytosed by neutrophils, but killing of conidia is inefficient. Similar to macrophages, the neutrophil respiratory burst induced by conidia is only 70% of that induced by zymosan (Drutz and Frey, 1985). In addition, yeasts are even more difficult for the neutrophils to phagocytose &amp; kill than conidia (Drutz and Frey, 1985). </p><p>Pneumocystis interacts with DCs in vitro by MR, (Kobayashi et al., 2007) but the interaction does not lead to an increase in maturation markers such as MHC II, CD40, CD54, CD80, or CD86. Additionally, this interaction induces the production of IL-4 but not IL-12p40, IL-10, TNF-•, or IL-6 (Kobayashi et al., 2007). However, Pneumocystis cell wall •-glucans have the ability to induce costimulatory molecule upregulation on DCs, such as MHC II, CD80, CD86, and CD40. These DCs interacted with •-glucans from Pneumocystis via dectin-1, and co-stimulatory molecule expression and Th1-type cytokine secretion by ┚-glucan stimulated DCs was regulated by Fas-Fas ligand interaction (Carmona et al., 2006). In vivo administration of DCs pulsed with Pneumocystis induced specific T cell responses and release of IL-4 as well as specific IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b production (Kobayashi et al., 2007). Alveolar macrophages have been shown to directly kill both Pneumocystis trophozoites and cysts (Fleury et al., 1985; reviewed in Kelly and Shellito, 2010). Specifically, alternatively-activated macrophages (aaMac) are important effector cells against Pneumocystis, and aaMac is enhanced by IL-33 (Nelson et al., 2011). In addition, Pneumocystis infection causes changes in gene expression of alveolar macrophages that included upregulation of genes involved in antigen presentation and antimicrobial peptides, but downregulation of genes involved in phagocytosis and uptake (Cheng et al., 2010). Pneumocystis major surface glycoprotein (MSG), which is a heavily glycosylated surface antigen, is recognized by MR on alveolar macrophages (Ezekowitz et al., 1991). Pneumocystis infection in HIV+ patients induces shedding of the MR, which results in reduced alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of the microbe (Koziel et al., 1998; Fraser et al., 2000). Neutrophils can also interact with Pneumocystis, but the presence of neutrophils is correlated with inflammation and increased severity of disease (reviewed in Kelly and Shellito, 2010). </p><p>Inhaled A. fumigatus conidia are first encountered by alveolar macrophages and neutrophils (reviewed in Hasenberg et al., 2011). Following uptake of Aspergillus by phagocytes, the organism enters the phagosome and killing occurs following phagosomal fusion with lysosomes, (Ibrahim-Granet et al., 2003). In the absence or impairment of phagocytic cells, there are dramatic increases in invasive Aspergillus infections (Latge, 1999). •-1,3 glucans of Aspergillus swollen conidia and hyphae are recognized by dectin-1 on the surface of alveolar macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils (Taylor et al., 2002; Taylor et al., 2007). This recognition of Aspergillus leads to phagocytosis and the production of cytokines such as TNF-•, IL-6, and IL-18 (Gersuk et al., 2006). In addition, Aspergillus can be recognized by TLRs, predominantly TLR2 and TLR4 (Wang et al., 2001; Mambula et al., 2002; Netea et al., 2002; Meier et al., 2003; Netea et al., 2003; Bellocchio et al., 2004; Bochud et al., 2008), but phagocytosis and uptake are not due to recognition by TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, or MyD88 (Bellocchio et al., 2004). More recent data also points to recognition of Aspergillus unmethylated DNA by TLR9 (Ramirez-Ortiz et al., 2008; Ramaprakash et al., 2009). Further, TLR9 is actively recruited to the Aspergillus phagosome and requires the N-terminal proteolytic cleavage domain for proper intracellular trafficking (Kasperkovitz et al., 2010). </p><p>DCs bind and internalize A. fumigatus through DC-SIGN, and this binding triggers DC maturation (Serrano-Gomez et al., 2004). Mouse DCs can internalize conidia of A. fumigatus using MR and a C-type lectin receptor as well as Fc•R (Bozza et al., 2002). Upon exposure of DCs to A. fumigatus, DCs upregulate HLA-DR, CD80 and CD86 (Grazziutti et al., 2001; Bozza et al., 2002). Following A. fumigatus infection, DCs can release the chemokine CXCL8, which promotes migration of PMNs, can upregulate CCL19, which is important in migration of CCR7+ naïve T cells and mature DCs to lymph nodes, and can release soluble factors that increase CD11b and CD18 on PMNs (Gafa et al., 2007). DC phagocytosis of A. fumigatus conidia and hyphae occur by different means and through different receptors; conidia are phagocytosed by coiling phagocytosis and hyphae are phagocytosed by zipper-type phagocytosis (Bozza et al., 2002). A. fumigatus killing by DCs is dependent on phagolysosomal fusion and a reduction in pH (Ibrahim-Granet et al., 2003). Plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) have the ability to spread over A. fumigatus hyphae and inhibit their growth </p><p>(Ramirez-Ortiz et al., 2011), and antifungal activity does not require direct cell contact. Following interaction of pDCs with Aspergillus, pDCs release pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-• and TNF-•, and these are produced via a TLR9-independent mechanism (Ramirez-Ortiz et al., 2011). During the early stages of Aspergillus infection, alternatively activated macrophages are recruited to the lung and are important in host defense (Bhatia et al., 2011). Studies examining the interaction of Aspergillus conidia with alveolar macrophages showed that infectivity and inhibition of macrophage killing by the fungus were due to the presence of a siderophore system that allows the fungus to acquire iron (Schrettl et al., 2010). In neutropenic mice, inflammatory DCs are recruited to the lungs during Aspergillus infection, and this recruitment is dependent on the absence of neutrophils (Park et al., 2010). This accumulation led to increased TNF-┙, CCL2, and CCL20, which resulted in further recruitment of inflammatory DCs. Neutrophils, when incubated with A. fumigatus hyphae, form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are antifungal, but mostly act in a fungistatic manner to limit spread of the hyphae (Bruns et al., 2010; Hasenberg et al., 2011). </p><p>In vitro studies of DCs with C. neoformans have shown that DCs are involved in detection, binding, phagocytosis, processing, antigen presentation, T cell activation, and killing of the organism (Bauman et al., 2000; Bauman et al., 2003; Wozniak et al., 2006; Wozniak and Levitz, 2008). DCs isolated from infected lungs presented cryptococcal mannoprotein (MP) to MP-specific T cells and induced T cell activation ex vivo (Wozniak et al., 2006). Depletion of DCs abrogated the T cell response (Mansour et al., 2006). Furthermore, DC phagocytosis of mannoprotein (MP) in the presence of the appropriate adjuvant induces production of Th1-type cytokines (Dan et al., 2008). Additional studies revealed that the interaction of C. neoformans with DCs, but not macrophages, induced the production of IL-12 and IL-23, two cytokines associated with protection against cryptococcosis (Kleinschek et al., 2010). Phagocytosis of encapsulated C. neoformans by DCs requires opsonization with either anti-capsular antibody or complement, and the combination of these has an additive effect (Kelly et al., 2005). Also, both murine and human DCs are able to kill C. neoformans, by both oxidative and non-oxidative mechanisms (Kelly et al., 2005). Recognition and uptake of acapsular C. neoformans strains by DCs requires MR and Fc•R II (Syme et al., 2002). TLR2 and TLR4 are not important in uptake of C. neoformans or activation of DCs by the fungus (Nakamura et al., 2006). DCs stimulated with DNA from C. neoformans release IL-12p40 and express CD40, a costimulatory molecule associated with DC maturation, and thus was tied to recognition by TLR9 (Nakamura et al., 2008). Upon infection with C. neoformans, CCR2-deficient mice, which are impaired in trafficking of monocyte-derived DCs, developed a non-protective Th2-type immune response and persistent infection, and had reduced DC recruitment, bronchovascular collagen deposition, and increased IL-4 production (Osterholzer et al., 2008). C. neoformans can also be phagocytosed by macrophages (Levitz et al., 1999; Del Poeta, 2004). Macrophage phenotypes are associated with differential immune responses against C. neoformans. Protection against infection is associated with the presence of classically-activated macrophages (caMac) (Zhang et al., 2009; Hardison et al., 2010a; Hardison et al., 2010b), while disease progression is associated with the presence of alternatively activated macrophages (aaMac) (Arora et al., 2005; Muller et al., 2007; Arora et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2007; Guerrero et al., 2010). Also, macrophages can serve as a site of replication of C. neoformans (Tucker and Casadevall, 2002). Intracellular replication rates within macrophages correlated to virulence for C. neoformans strains (Voelz et al., 2009). In addition to replication, yeasts can be expulsed from macrophages by a non-lytic mechanism that leaves both C. neoformans and macrophages intact and capable of replication and growth (Alvarez and Casadevall, 2006; Ma et al., 2006; Alvarez and Casadevall, 2007; Johnston and May, 2010). C. neoformans can also be phagocytosed by activated neutrophils (Kozel et al., 1987). The capsule of C. neoformans induces neutrophils to release proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1•, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-• (Retini et al., 1996). Neutrophils can kill C. neoformans by non-oxidative mechanisms, including neutrophil defensins and calprotectin (Mambula et al., 2000). Interestingly, induction of neutropenia in mouse models of infection reduces their susceptibility to infection (Mednick et al., 2003). </p><p>Although innate immune responses against Rhizopus, the main causative agent of mucormycosis, have not yet been fully characterized, recent work has shown that Rhizopus can trigger a common innate sensing pathway in DCs that leads to the production of IL-23 and drives Th17-type responses (Chamilos et al., 2010). This is due to interaction of dectin -1 with •-glucans on the surface of Rhizopus hyphae. </p><p>3.2 NK cell activity </p><p>Another innate immune response to pulmonary fungal pathogens is due to recognition and action by natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells were thought to act primarily against viruses and tumors, but more recent studies have shown that NK cells have a wide variety of functions against bacteria, fungi, and parasites (Newman and Riley, 2007). </p><p>In H. capsulatum infection, there is little evidence of a protective role for NK cells. While beige mice (lacking functional NK cells) are more susceptible to H. capsulatum infection, T cells play a greater role in controlling infection (Patino et al., 1987). In studies evaluating both beige mice and mice depleted of NK cells, beige mice were still more susceptible to infection, while mice depleted of NK cells were no more susceptible to infection than WT mice, therefore indicating no major role for NK cells in protection (Suchyta et al., 1988). However, mice deficient in perforin, a major component of NK cell anti-microbial activity, had accelerated mortality and increased fungal burden (Zhou et al., 2001). Infection with Coccidioides during depletion of NK cells leads to increased susceptibility to infection (Petkus and Baum, 1987). Furthermore, NK cells have a direct cytotoxic effect on Coccidioides young spherule and endospore cells (Petkus and Baum, 1987). In Paracoccidioides, studies have shown increased NK cell activity in infected hamsters compared to uninfected controls. Impaired NK cell activity was associated with a decrease in cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and an increase in histopathologic lesions. However, after initial activation, NK cells alone were not able to control dissemination of Paracoccidiodes (Peracoli et al., 1995). In vitro NK cell activity correlated with growth inhibition of Paracoccidiodes yeast (Jimenez and Murphy, 1984). </p><p>In neutropenic mice with A. fumigatus infection, NK cells are the major cell type responsible for the production of IFN-• early in the infection. Additionally, depletion of NK cells reduces IFN-• levels and caused increased pulmonary fungal load (Park et al., 2009). NK cells have direct anti-fungal activity against hyphae but not against resting conidia (Schmidt et al., 2011). Killing is due to production of mediators by NK cells, including perforin. However, A. fumigatus can also down-regulate some cytokines induced by the NK cells, including IFN-• and GM-CSF (Schmidt et al., 2011). In addition, recruitment of NK cells to the lung during A. fumigatus infection by the chemokine MCP-1 is required for optimal clearance of the organism from the lungs (Morrison et al., 2003). During Pneumocystis infection in SCID mice (lacking T and B cells), NK cells were responsible for production of cytokines such as IFN-•, TNF-•, TNF-•, IL-10, and IL-12 (Warschkau et al., 1998). Recent studies have shown that NK cells are recruited to the lung during Pneumocystis infection and are important in fungal clearance of murine PCP (M. Kelly and J. Shellito, personal communication). Further, combined depletion of NK and CD4+ T cells resulted in increased pulmonary fungal burden compared to individual depletion of each subset. In vitro, NK cells have direct microbicidal activity against Pneumocystis, and this anti-fungal activity is significantly enhanced in the presence of CD4+ T cells, suggesting that both cell types are necessary for a protective response against Pneumocystis infection (M. Kelly and J. Shellito, personal communication). Early studies showed that NK cells can directly kill C. neoformans (Murphy and McDaniel, 1982). Further, IFN-• production by NK cells enhances elimination of the fungus in murine models (Kawakami et al., 2001a; Kawakami et al., 2001b; Kawakami et al., 2001c). Depletion of NK cells using anti-asialo GM antibody resulted in increased fungal burden in mice (Hidore et al., 1991a; Hidore et al., 1991b). Increased fungal burden was seen in beige mice compared to wild-type mice, and in mice depleted of NK1.1+ NK cells, fungal burden was also increased compared to controls (Lipscomb et al., 1987; Salkowski and Balish, 1991). Human NK cells kill C. neoformans (Levitz and Dupont, 1993), and this killing is enhanced in the presence of anti-cryptococcal antibodies (Miller et al., 1990). Binding of NK cells is required for cryptococcal killing, and requires disulfide bonds and is dependent on magnesium (Nabavi and Murphy, 1985; Hidore and Murphy, 1989; Murphy et al., 1991). Killing of C. neoformans is due to perforin interaction with the organism (Ma et al., 2004; Marr et al., 2009). In summary, NK cells act as accessory cells in antifungal host defenses contributing to clearance of fungi by a variety of mechanisms. </p><p>3.3 Gamma/delta T cell activity </p><p>The role of gamma delta (••) T cells during the immune response to pulmonary fungal pathogens is diverse. During infection with Cryptococcus, mice genetically deficient or depleted in •• T cells have reduced fungal burden compared to controls. Further, mice lacking •••T cells had increased levels of IFN-• and decreased levels of TGF-• compared to controls, therefore suggesting that •••T cells are detrimental to protective immunity during cryptococcal infection (Uezu et al., 2004). In Pneumocystis pneumonia, CD4+ T cells are necessary for protection against infection, but •• cells are known to infiltrate into the lung during pneumonia (Kagi et al., 1993; Agostini et al., 1995; Steele et al., 2002). However, resolution of pulmonary Pneumocystis infection is augmented in •• T cell-deficient mice, (Steele et al., 2002), suggesting that these cells are detrimental to clearance of the organism. Further, the absence of •• T cells led to an increase in recruitment of CD8+ T cells and production of cytokines such as IFN-•. Complete lack of all T cell subsets (•• and ••) during </p><p>Pneumocystis infection led to lethal consequences (Hanano and Kaufmann, 1999). Thus, •••••cells have•either a limited •role in antifungal protection or are detrimental to antifungal </p><p>host defenses. </p><p>3.4 Innate anti-fungal defenses by non-immune cells </p><p>While innate immune cells and components of the innate immune system are the predominant innate immune defenses, it has also been shown that unconventional cells, such as epithelial cells can also play a role in anti-fungal innate host responses. Airway epithelial cells are capable of uptake and processing of antigens and initiation of Th-type immune responses (Gereke et al., 2009). P. brasiliensis interacts with and can be internalized by bronchial epithelial cells (Mendes-Giannini et al., 1994, and this internalization is due to activation of a tyrosine kinase pathway (Monteiro da Silva et al., 2007; Hanna et al., 2000). In addition, uptake of P. brasiliensis causes both cytoskeletal rearrangements as well as apoptosis of the epithelial cells (Mendes-Giannini et al., 2004). C. neoformans can bind to pulmonary epithelial cells by a mechanism believed to be due to carbohydrate moieties that can be a ligand for the yeast (Merkel and Scofield, 1997). C. neoformans interaction with bronchial epithelial cells causes the production of IL-8, but epithelial cells are also susceptible to damage by the organism (Guillot et al., 2008a). In A. fumigatus infection, conidia can be taken up by tracheal epithelial cells, alveolar type II cells, and endothelial cells (Paris et al., 1997). Further, cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 are released by epithelial cells in vitro following stimulation with A. fumigatus proteases (Borger et al., 1999) or by A. fumigatus hyphal fragments (Zhang et al., 2005) and nasal epithelium. And nasal epithelium can engulf A. fumigatus conidia (Botterel et al., 2008). Epithelial cells can also release antimicrobial peptides following stimulation with fungal organisms. Epithelial cells in vitro cultured with A. fumigatus conidia, swollen conidia, or hyphae produced large amounts of beta defensins (Alekseeva et al., 2009). Airway epithelial cells internalize A. fumigatus conidia, and a genome-wide analysis revealed differential gene expression in epithelial cells with conidia compared to cells without conidia. Genes that were upregulated with conidia included genes involved in repair and inflammation, such as matrix metalloproteinases and chemokines (Gomez et al., 2010). In Pneumocystis, several studies have shown that the organism interacts with pulmonary epithelial cells. The interaction of Pneumocystis with epithelial cells was shown to be one of the initial steps in infection (Lanken et al., 1980; Yoneda and Walzer, 1980; Long et al., 1986; Millard et al., 1990). The •-glucan from the Pneumocystis cell wall can stimulate pulmonary epithelial cells to produce IL-8, and the organism can induce the production of MCP-1 and ICAM -1 (Yu and Limper, 1997; Evans et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007; Carmona et al., 2010). Interaction of Pneumocystis and alveolar epithelial cells also leads to the production of the chemokine MIP-2 following NF-•B signaling (Evans et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2005). These studies show that non-immune cells, such as epithelial cells, play a role in pulmonary anti-fungal immunity. </p><p>4. T cell and antibody mediated immune responses to fungal infections </p><p>4.1 Adaptive responses against pulmonary fungal pathogens </p><p>When challenged with pathogenic fungi, the adaptive immune system is capable of mounting an effective response against most fungal species to eliminate fungal infections and maintain immunological memory that prevents their reoccurrence. However, fungi are ubiquitous in the host's environment including the saprophytes and opportunists that survive on the host's body surfaces and thus, the adaptive immune system is constantly challenged by fungal antigens. Excessive response to these antigens could lead to allergic responses or other types of immunopathological reactions. The balance between day-to-day fungal antigen exposure and the immune system is thought to lead to a homeostatic state defined as protective tolerance. Protective tolerance allows the host to keep possible fungal pathogens \"in check\" while preserving integrity of the natural barriers, which are potential portals for fungal infections (Romani and Puccetti, 2008; de Luca et al., 2010a; Littman and Rudensky, 2010). </p><p>T cells are responsible for orchestration of adaptive immune responses and T cell derived signals produced in response to specific antigens lead to targeted expansion, recruitment, activation of leukocytes, and regulation of B cell antibody responses. T cells also serve as a pool of immunological memory. Additionally, T cells have been shown to directly act as the fungicidal effector cells and serve as regulators of inflammatory responses, contributing to the development and maintenance of the protective tolerance. These regulatory mechanisms are designed to limit the damage that the host immune system can inflict on host tissues during incorrect and/or excessive host responses. Thus, properly functioning T cells are responsible for building up protective immunity against fungal pathogens and play an essential role in maintaining normal homeostasis of the immune system in the context of normal presence of fungal antigens. </p><p>4.2 CD4 +\nand CD8 +\nT cell mediated immunity </p><p>The importance of T cells in antifungal protection is well documented. T-cell deficient individuals show diminished resistance to fungal infections including coccidiomycosis (Kappe et al., 1998) cryptococcosis (Kovacs et al., 1985; Chuck and Sande, 1989; Spitzer et al., 1993; Jarvis and Harrison, 2007), histoplamosis (Odio et al., 1999), pneumocystis pneumonia (Kelly and Shellito), Paracoccidioides (Bava et al., 1991; Brummer et al., 1993), as well as pulmonary aspergillosis (Mylonakis et al., 1998). Likewise, laboratory studies have shown a strong contribution and/or requirement of T cells for protection against most pathogenic fungi such as Coccidioides (Fierer et al., 2006), Cryptococcus (Lim and Murphy, 1980; Mody et al., 1990; Huffnagle et al., 1991; Huffnagle and Lipscomb, 1992; Mody et al., 1994), Pneumocystis (Harmsen and Stankiewicz, 1990), Histoplasma (Deepe et al., 1984), Paracoccidioides (Cano et al., 2000) and Aspergillus (Cenci et al., 1997). These epidemiological and experimental studies have established that T cells are an important component of the antifungal host resistance. </p><p>Both subsets of T lymphocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ cells, are involved in antifungal host defenses. CD4+ T cells classically represent the T helper cell population. The T helper function was defined by MHC II restricted antigen specific activation of B-cell clones needed for the generation of specific antibodies. The CD4+ cell function in cell-mediated immunity (CMI) likewise requires antigen presenting cells and MHC II restricted antigen presentation. Presentation of antigen to the reactive T cells by dendritic cells and/or macrophages results in cytokine production. Through generation of different cytokine spectra, CD4+ T cells orchestrate recruitment and activation of various leukocyte subsets. The cytokines produced by the effector T cells are essential for macrophage fungicidal function and granuloma formation, but also may support chronic inflammation and immunopathology (Arora et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2008; Jain et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Thus, cytokine induction by differentially polarized T-cell lineages is the major determinant for fungicidal potential of distal effector cells. Although the effector CD4+ cell function relies predominantly on cytokine production, CD4+ T-cells are capable of fungal killing via direct cell contact. At least in some biological circumstances, the direct fungicidal effect of CD4+ T cells relies on granulysin as the fungicidal mediator (Zheng et al., 2007; Zheng et al., 2008). </p><p>In contrast with CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells are classically viewed as cytotoxic lymphocytes. These cells respond to antigen presentation in the context of MHC I, to enable their cytotoxic machinery. Such cytotoxic responses are particularly crucial in responses to viral infection and tumor cells, leading to elimination of the virally infected or tumor-transformed cells by cytotoxic lymphocytes. CD8+ cells also play an important role in host defenses to bacterial, parasitic and fungal infections (Oykhman and Mody, 2010). Numerous studies showed that CD8+ T cells significantly contribute to protection against Cryptococcus, Pneumocystis, Histoplasma and Blastomyces, even in the absence of CD4+ T cells. Depending on the type and virulence of the fungal pathogen, CD8+ cells could afford either partial or a complete protection against the major fungal pathogens in experimental models. In this context, CD8+ T cells could induce all the protective effector functions of CD4+ T cells including production of protective cytokines. Another important aspect of CD8+ T cell effector function is the direct fungicidal effect of CD8+ T cells. Such direct fungicidal activity of CD8+ T cells have been demonstrated for C. neoformans (Ma et al., 2002). The killing of C. neoformans requires direct cell contact; it is enhanced by IL-15 and is thought to be mediated by granulysin. The direct cytotoxic effects are most pronounced when lymphocytes from fungus-immunized mice are used, however, a relatively high rate of binding of T cells to the fungus suggests that these cytotoxic mechanisms are innate rather than adaptive. </p><p>4.3 Immune polarization in antifungal host defenses </p><p>T helper cell subsets characterized by differential cytokine production by differentially programmed T-cell lineages were initially defined as Th1 and Th2 (Mosmann et al., 1986; Cherwinski et al., 1987). The types of immune responses driven by each of these cell lineages are described as Th1 and Th2 immune responses, generate different types of immune effector responses, and show different spectra of effectiveness against different classes of pathogens. For effective control/clearance of the majority of fungal pathogens, Th1 is the required type of the immune response. The Th1 response is promoted by IL-12, IFN-┛, and TNF-┙. The two latter cytokines are also the major products of Th1 helper T cells (Cherwinski et al., 1987). Th1-type T-cells are responsible for the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions and CMI associated with vigorous proinflammatory responses and granuloma formation (Cher and Mosmann, 1987) and induction of IgG2a class antibodies in B cells (Stevens et al., 1988). The Th2 immune response is characterized by T-cell production of IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-13 (Cherwinski et al., 1987), IgG1 and IgE antibody production by B cells (Stevens et al., 1988) and the presence of eosinophilic inflammation (Huffnagle et al., 1994; Cenci et al., 1999; Olszewski et al., 2001). The Th1 and Th2 responses counter-regulate each other predominantly via an IL-4/IFN-┛ negative feedback loop (Fernandez-Botran et al., 1988; Gajewski and Fitch, 1988); however other cytokines can be also involved in Th1/Th2 regulation. The oversimplified Th1/Th2 paradigm has further evolved as new T cell lineages were defined. Th17 and regulatory type T cells (Treg), are T-cell lineages that are distinct from Th1 and Th2 cells that possess distinct functions in host defenses. Th17 cells are generated following the priming with IL-6 and TGF-┚ and sustained by the presence of IL-23. Th17 cells classically produce IL-17 and IL-22, however, a subset of Th17 cells can produce IFN-┛. Regulatory T-cells are thought to be responsible for tolerance that prevents autoimmune diseases and to contribute to resolution of inflammatory responses. These effects of Tregs are thought to be mediated by anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-┚, which are signature cytokines for Treg cells. New Th-cell lineages continue to be described including Th22 (Eyerich et al., 2009; Fujita et al., 2009) and Th9 (Soroosh and Doherty, 2009). Just like CD4+ effector T-cells, CD8+ T cells can also display a polarization pattern and thus can be an important source of the polarizing cytokines. Thus, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells contribute to the cytokine balance during the immune response (Huffnagle et al., 1994). </p><p>4.4 Th1/2/17/22 cytokine responses </p><p>The protective role of Th1 along with the requirement of type 1 cytokines for fungal clearance have been demonstrated in models of cryptococcosis (Huffnagle et al., 1994; Kawakami et al., 1997; Blackstock et al., 1999; Abe et al., 2000; Traynor et al., 2000; Olszewski et al., 2001; Herring et al., 2002; Arora et al., 2005; Hernandez et al., 2005; Lindell et al., 2006; Wormley et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2008; Guillot et al., 2008b; Jain et al., 2009; Wozniak et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009), Coccidioides (Silva and Benitez, 2005), Paracocidioides (Cano et al., 1998), Histoplama (Zhou et al., 1995; Deepe and Gibbons, 2006) and Blastomyces (Brummer et al., 2006) infections. Th1 skewing is beneficial for clearance of Aspergillus (Cenci et al., 1997), although clearance of the filamentous fungi is mainly a domain of the innate immune system. The Th1 cytokine environment promotes clearance of fungi by supporting the classical activation of macrophages (Mantovani et al., 2001). Pathogenic fungi possess mechanisms that interfere with their recognition by macrophages. These fungi can survive within macrophage unless additional \"external\" stimulation occurs to activate fungicidal mechanisms. Such stimulation can be provided by Th1-type cytokines, especially IFN-┛ (Arora et al., 2005; Hardison et al.). In the context of a Th1 immune response, macrophages become classically activated and abundantly generate fungicidal molecules such as nitric oxide produced by nitric oxide synthase, an enzyme that utilizes L-arginine. Importance of classical macrophage activation and production of nitric oxide for fungal clearance has been demonstrated for Blastomyces (Brummer et al., 2005; Kethineni et al., 2006), Cryptococcus (Granger et al., 1990; Alspaugh and Granger, 1991; Rivera et al., 2002; Arora et al., 2005; Zhang et al.; Hardison et al.), Histoplasma (Zhou et al., 1995; Allendoerfer and Deepe, 1998; Allen and Deepe, 2006) and Paracocidiodes (Moreira et al.; Pinzan et al.) infections. The deficiencies in cytokines that support classical activation of macrophages GM-CSF, IFN-┛, TNF-┙, IL-12 are generally associated with the development of progressive fungal infection (Romani et al., 1994; Kawakami et al., 1999; Rayhane et al., 1999; Herring et al., 2005; Deepe and Gibbons, 2006) consistent with the general conclusion that Th1-type immune responses and type 1 cytokines are most optimal for resistance against fungal infections. </p><p>Unlike Th1-type responses, the Th2 response is non-protective and frequently results in pathological responses to fungal challenges. For most fungal species, Th2 responses and type 2 cytokines decrease clearance of fungus. This is attributed to: 1) a suppression of protective Th1 responses due to a mutual counterregulatory feedback loop (Cenci et al., 1999) and 2) a generation of alternatively activated macrophages that can harbor fungal organisms (Arora et al., 2005; Jain et al., 2009; Osterholzer et al., 2009a; Zhang et al., 2009). Th2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-13 are the major trigger of alternative activation of macrophages (Arora et al., 2005; Jain et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). These alternatively activated macrophages do not express nitric oxide synthase but induce arginase which metabolizes L-arginine without yielding fungicidal nitric oxide. In the Th2 biased experimental models of fungal infections, intracellular survival of fungus within macrophages parallels high induction of alternatively activated macrophage markers (Arora et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2009; Hardison et al.). </p><p>Increased production of Th2-type cytokines has been associated with increased susceptibility to Cryptococcus (Arora et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2009; Hardison et al.) and Paracoccidioides (Ruas et al., 2009) infections and to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (Cenci et al., 1997; Cenci et al., 1999). Fungus-triggered Th2-type responses in the respiratory system may also lead to allergic diseases such rhinitis/sinusitis, asthma, allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis. Th2 type responses are highly detrimental to the respiratory system by promoting mucus hypersecretion/goblet cell metaplasia, eosinophilic inflammation, and peribronchial fibrosis all of which contribute to impaired airway function. Cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 are the major triggers of these pathologies as increased expression of these cytokines can be reproduced along with the allergic symptoms in the lungs challenged with fungi or their antigenic components (Blease et al., 2000; Arora et al., 2005; Jain et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Some of the fungal antigens can directly promote Th2 skewing. The secreted protein fraction from Aspergillus fumigatus promotes Th2 bias of the immune response (Bozza et al., 2009). Th2 pathologies are also found in mouse models of C. neoformans infections (Abe et al., 2000; Jain et al., 2009; Osterholzer et al., 2009b) (Figure 1). Expression of enzymes phospholipase B and urease by C. neoformans promote Th2 bias in the infected mice (Noverr et al., 2003; Osterholzer et al., 2009b). While Th2-biased responses are clearly undesirable in most types of fungal infections the exception is Pneumocystis infection, in which the Th2 response can contribute to fungal clearance (Shellito et al., 2000; McKinley et al., 2006; Hu et al., 2009). </p><p>Fig. 1. Classical versus alternative activation of macrophages during pulmonary infection with C. neoformans. A) Classically activated macrophages upregulate fungicidal mechanisms that eliminate ingested fungi. Note that ingested intracellular organisms show signs of degradation. B) Alternatively activated macrophages (AAM) harbor the ingested fungi. Note the abundant capsule formation (evidence of fungal metabolic activity) and dividing organisms (evidence of intracellular growth) within AAM. Alternative activation of macrophages is associated with crystallization of chitinase family proteins YM1 and YM2, a hallmark of AAM-induced pathology.

Thus, Th17 responses may be beneficial for some types of fungal infections or </p><p> </p><p>Fig. 2. Th polarization in antifungal host defenses. The outcome of Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg polarization results from balance between Th lineages which can mutually regulate each other via cytokine feedback loops. Resultant outcome can either promote clearance of the fungal infection or result in persistent infection and limited or severe pathology. Th1 response promotes control of most fungal infections; Th2 leads to severe pathology and fungal persistence; Th17 may support clearance or persistence of different fungal infections, but may promote chronic neutrophilic inflammation. Treg may limit pathology by promoting resolution of the inflammatory response, but may increase the risk of persistence. Correct balance between Th1 and Treg is thought to support protective tolerance. </p><p>exhibit detrimental effects. In the H. capsulatum infection model, IL-17 neutralization increases pulmonary fungal burden in connection with increased Treg numbers, suggesting that Th17 is beneficial for clearance of Histoplasma (Kroetz and Deepe, 2010). Th17 responses also contribute to anticryptococcal protection and the development of the protective inflammatory response in C. neoformans infected lungs (Zhang et al., 2009; Hardison et al., 2010b; Wozniak et al., 2011a). </p><p>The IL-23/IL-17 axis contributes to clearance of Pneumocystis (Rudner et al., 2007). However, in IFN-┛ deficient mice infected with Pneumocystis the development of strong Th17 response is detrimental, suggesting that a balance between IFN-┛ and IL-17 is needed for optimal clearance of Pneumocystis (Hu et al., 2009). At other mucosal sites, the effects of Th17 are variable. Th17 cells and IL-17 receptor signaling are required for mucosal host defenses in oral candidiasis (Conti et al., 2009); whereas Th17 impairs antifungal resistance and promotes inflammation in gastric infection model (Zelante et al., 2007). Th17 responses impair antifungal resistance and promotes inflammatory damage in the lungs of mice infected with Aspergillus (Zelante et al., 2007; Bozza et al., 2009; D'Angelo et al., 2009). </p><p>Overall, the Th17 response may have beneficial effects for clearance of some fungal pathogens; however it also has high potential to produce undesirable effects, including inflammatory damage. </p><p>Excessive immune reaction and uncontrolled inflammation can result in serious damage of the inflicted organs and tissues. Anti-inflammatory or regulatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-┚ are an important part of the balance which prevents over exuberant inflammation during acute responses. These cytokines are also thought to be important components of resolution and tissue repair that occurs after elimination of the pathogen. Regulatory T cells are important sources of these cytokines and their role in inflammatory diseases and in the maintenance of healthy tissue homeostasis becomes increasingly appreciated (Romani and Puccetti, 2008; De Luca et al., 2010b; Littman and Rudensky, 2010). The importance of balance between pro-inflammatory processes and Treg cell regulation has recently been demonstrated in models of Pneumocystis (McKinley et al., 2006) and Histoplasma infections (Kroetz and Deepe). The excessive/damaging inflammatory reaction can be exemplified by immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). IRIS is characterized by uncontrolled inflammatory responses with high induction of IFN-┛, TNF-┙ and other pro-inflammatory cytokines (Mori and Levin, 2009). Overproduction of these cytokines, rather than having protective effects, contributes to tissue injury that leads to worsening of the patient condition and high mortality (Mori and Levin, 2009). Interestingly, occurrence of IRIS in HIV patients who undergo antiretroviral therapy is particularly high in patients with Cryptococcus and Pneumocystis infections (Singh et al., 2005; Singh and Perfect, 2007; Murdoch et al., 2008). The mechanism of inadequate inflammatory response in IRIS is not understood, however it has been proposed that the regulatory mechanisms that control the inflammation, including Tregs are not sufficiently mobilized to put a break on this inflammatory response (McKinley et al., 2006; Shankar et al., 2008). In fact, patients with IRIS showed reduced suppressor function and diminished secretion of anti-inflammatory IL-10 by Tregs in one of the studies (Seddiki et al., 2009). Tregs are critical for maintaining the proper homeostasis in the GI track, and such mechanisms of protective tolerance are likely to be critical in the respiratory tract which is constantly exposed to inhaled fungal antigens. Insufficiency of the regulatory mechanisms most likely contributes to the development of allergic diseases. Thus, Tregs cells are important for maintaining balance between appropriate clearance rate and the inflammatory tissue damage. Such balance can be disturbed and the excessive Treg function may promote fungal persistence. A detrimental role of IL-10 has been demonstrated in cryptococcal infection models (Blackstock et al., 1999; Arora et al., 2005). Future studies will be needed to evaluate the possible role of Tregs in fungal infections, especially in the patients who develop mycoses without apparent immunodeficiency. </p><p>The polarization of T cells to Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg lineages is important for the development of protective immunity, protective tolerance, chronic/allergic syndromes, or overwhelming allergic reactions. The proper balance maintained by the mutual regulation between these arms of the immune system is necessary to optimize clearance and minimize inflammatory damage to the infected tissues in the context of fungal infection. Our present understanding of these responses evolved from an oversimplified polarized Th1/Th2 paradigm to a broader understanding of mutual regulation ongoing during the immune process. Recent studies show that the Th1, Th2, Th17 responses co-exist in a fungus infected lungs and the balance of cytokine production alters during different time points in a chronic fungal infection (Arora et al., 2011). Modulation of these responses can be achieved experimentally and therapeutically by use of cytokines and vaccination with different fractions of fungal antigens resulting in the induction of the proper and protective Th-cell polarization. </p><p>4.5 Vaccine-induced therapies targeting cellular mediated immunity </p><p>Currently, there are no standardized vaccines available for the prevention of fungal diseases in humans (as discussed earlier). A preponderance of evidence points to the development of cell-mediated immune responses, principally by Th1-type CD4+ T cells, as the predominant host defense mechanism against primary and opportunistic pulmonary fungal pathogens (Cutler et al., 2007). Further, ablation or neutralization of several Th1-type cytokines renders mice more susceptible to experimental infection with a number of fungal pathogens. Consequently, there has been great interest in identifying antigens that elicit protective CMI against fungal infections; some of which will be discussed herein. </p><p>Vaccination with native or recombinant Hsp60 from H. capsulatum or a domain within Hsp60 conferred protection in mice given a sub-lethal challenge with yeast cells and prolonged survival in mice given a lethal challenge (Gomez et al., 1995; Deepe and Gibbons, 2002). Protection was CD4+ T cell dependent and associated with the induction of IFN-┛, IL-12 and, surprisingly, the Th2-type cytokine IL-10 (Deepe and Gibbons, 2002; Scheckelhoff and Deepe, 2005). A similar vaccination strategy in mice using Hsp70 did not induce robust IL-12 or IFN-┛ responses and protection against subsequent challenge with live yeast. Neutralization of IL-12 or IFN-┛ abolished the protective efficacy of the Hsp60 vaccine in mice further highlighting the importance of these Th1-type cytokines in the induction of protection against H. capsulatum. </p><p>Similarly, vaccination of mice with recombinant Hsp60 derived from P. brasiliensis elicited protection against a lethal intranasal challenge with yeast (de Bastos Ascenco Soares et al., 2008). The protective effect of P. basiliensis Hsp60 was abrogated following the depletion of CD4+ T cells or neutralization of IFN-┛; similar to that observed for Hsp60 from H. capsulatum (Scheckelhoff and Deepe, 2005; de Bastos Ascenco Soares et al., 2008). However, IL-10 was not produced following antigen stimulation of splenocytes obtained from P. basiliensis Hsp60 immunized mice. While the efficacy of vaccination with forms of Hsp60 from H. capsulatum and P. brasiliensis are encouraging, immunization with recombinant Hsp60 derived from C. immitis resulted in predominantly Th2 cytokine responses and little protection against a subsequent intraperitoneal challenge (Li et al., 2001). Thus, the induction of Th1-type immune responses in the lungs appears critical for the development of protection following immunization with Hsp60. </p><p>Evaluation of live attenuated, recombinant, and DNA vaccines of C. immitis in murine models have also highlighted the importance of Th1-type cytokine production, particularly IFN-┛, in protection against this microbe (reviewed in (Cole et al., 2004; Cox and Magee, 2004; Xue et al., 2009)). Mice immunized with recombinant aspartyl protease (Pep1), alpha-mannosidase (Amn1), or phospholipase B (Plb) individually or together as amultivalent vaccine experienced a significant reduction in fungal burden and prolonged survival against a lethal pulmonary challenge with C. posadasii arthroconidia compared to controls (Tarcha et al., 2006). Approximately 85% of mice immunized with the multivalent recombinant vaccine survived to day 90 post-inoculation. Similarly, immunization of mice with two recombinant antigens, Coccidiodes-specific antigen (CSA) and the proline-rich cell wall protein Ag2/PRA, either as a mixture of two separately expressed proteins or as a single chimeric expression product was shown to protect mice from a lethal intranasal infection with C. posadasii (Shubitz et al., 2006). The protection observed with each vaccination strategy was associated with robust IFN-┛ responses in protected mice, again showing the importance of Th1-type cytokines during protective host responses. Further, these studies highlighted the utility of a multivalent vaccination strategy that potentially evokes protective responses towards a broader set of T-cell epitopes. </p><p>The importance of CD4+ T cells and the generation of Th1-type responses towards eliciting protection against pulmonary fungal pathogens are also observed in vaccination models using a live C. neoformans strain engineered to express IFN-┛ (Wormley et al., 2007) (Wozniak et al., 2009) (Young et al., 2009), a live attenuated strain of B. dermatitidis (Wuthrich et al., 2000), and recombinant A. fumigatus protein Asp f3 (Diaz-Arevalo et al., 2011). Immunization with recombinant Asp f3 of A. fumigatus protected cortisone acetate immune suppressed mice from an experimental pulmonary infection with A. fumigatus conidia (Diaz-Arevalo et al., 2011). The protection was dependent on CD4+ T cells as their depletion reduced the survival of vaccinated mice and adoptive transfer of Aspf3 primed CD4+ T cells into non-vaccinated mice enhanced their survival against experimentally induced pulmonary aspergillosis. Generation of sterilizing immunity in mice following pulmonary immunization with a C. neoformans strain engineered to express murine IFN-┛, designated H99┛, was shown to require the induction of Th1-type cell-mediated immune responses (Wozniak et al., 2009). Interestingly, B-cell deficient mice immunized with H99┛ were protected from a subsequent lethal pulmonary challenge with WT C. neoformans (Wozniak et al., 2009; Young et al., 2009; Wozniak et al., 2011b). Also, vaccination of mice with an attenuated strain of B. dermatitidis containing a targeted deletion in the BAD1 locus resulted in prolonged survival that was chiefly mediated by IFN-┛ and TNF-┙ production by CD4+ T cells (Wuthrich et al., 2000; Wuthrich et al., 2002). Although these studies show that Th1-type CD4+ T cell responses are required for optimal host responses against these pulmonary pathogens, studies in H. capsulatum, B. dermititidis, and C. neoformans highlight the inherent plasticity of the host response against pulmonary fungal pathogens. That is that some elements of the immune response can compensate for the loss of other components. </p><p>Vaccine-induced immunity against B. dermatitidis was shown be mediated by CD4+ ┙/┚ T cell production of TNF-┙ and IFN-┛ (Wuthrich et al., 2002). Moreover, the initiation, but not maintenance, of protective memory responses to B dermatitidis required IL-12 production (Wuthrich et al., 2005). However, vaccine-induced immunity could be elicited and expressed in IFN-┛ and TNF-┙ deficient mice. The reciprocal cytokine or the presence of GM-CSF was shown to compensate for the loss of IFN-┛ and TNF-┙ showing some plasticity in the vaccine-induced host response to Blastomyces (Wuthrich et al., 2002). Furthermore, a role for Th17 cells in vaccine-induced protection against multiple pulmonary fungal pathogens has been shown (Wuthrich et al., 2011). Specifically, protection afforded by vaccination against C. posadassi, H. capsulatum, and B. dermatitidis was observed to be dependent on IL-17. In fact, IL-17 was shown to be indispensable since vaccinated IL-17A or IL-17RA deficient mice showed impaired anti-fungal resistance despite having normal Th1-type cytokine expression. In contrast, IL-17A was shown to contribute to but ultimately be dispensable for protection against experimental pulmonary cryptococcosis in C. neoformans strain H99┛ vaccinated mice (Hardison et al., 2010b; Wozniak et al., 2011a). Still, it appears imperative that vaccines strategies to prevent pulmonary mycoses be evaluated for their capacity to induce Th1 and Th17-type cytokine responses. </p><p>The induction of T cell-mediated immune responses is critical for optimal protection against pulmonary fungal pathogens (Cutler et al., 2007). Consequently, it may seem counterintuitive to suggest that vaccines designed to prevent fungal infections in patients with T cell deficiencies is possible. Nonetheless, vaccination studies using experimental models of H. capsulatum (Deepe and Gibbons, 2002), P. brasiliensis (de Bastos Ascenco Soares et al., 2008), H. capsulatum (Wuthrich et al., 2003), B. dermatitidis (Wuthrich et al., 2002; Wuthrich et al., 2003), C. immitis (Fierer et al., 2006), and C. neoformans (Wozniak et al., 2011b) have indicated that vaccine-induced protective immune responses can be elicited in immune deficient hosts. Cumulatively, the studies show that the presence of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells is essential for the induction (the period following vaccination) and expression (immune response following challenge) phases of the protective immune response. Protection is not induced in mice that are T cell deficient or depleted of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations. Further, protection is lost in vaccinated mice following deletion of both T cell subsets. Interestingly, 80% of mice vaccinated with C. neoformans strain H99┛ and subsequently depleted of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were protected from a lethal pulmonary challenge with WT C. neoformans (Wozniak et al., 2011b). These studies highlight dynamic compensatory mechanisms that mediate vaccine-induced protection during both the induction and expression phases of the anti-fungal immune response. Altogether, the results demonstrating the plasticity of the vaccine-induced immune response to pulmonary fungal pathogens are particularly exciting as they highlight the potential for inducing protection in immune competent and immune compromised hosts. </p><p>4.6 Antibody-mediated immunity and therapeutics </p><p>The contribution of antibody mediated immunity (AMI) towards protecting individuals against pulmonary fungal infections remains uncertain. Individuals with humoral deficiencies such as autosomal hyper-IgM syndrome and IgA deficiency do not exhibit an increased susceptibility to fungal infections (reviewed in Antachopoulos, 2007, 2010). In contrast, patients with X-linked hyper IgM syndrome and common-variable immunodeficiency which are often accompanied by defects in T CMI have a higher risk of developing pulmonary and invasive fungal infections like cryptococcosis and histoplasmosis. The efficacious role for antibodies during the host immune responses against fungi is like that observed against bacterial and viral pathogens. Antibodies produced in response to fungal infection serve as opsonins to promote phagocytosis, participate in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, augment Th1-type polarization, help to eliminate immunosuppressive polysaccharide antigen from serum and tissues, inhibit biofilm formation, have direct antifungal activity, and modulate the immune response to prevent host damage (reviewed in Alvarez and Casadevall, 2007; reviewed in Zaragoza and Casadevall, 2004). </p><p>Most studies showing the efficacy of AMI against pulmonary fungal pathogens has involved experimental models of PcP and cryptocococcosis. The polysaccharide capsule of Cryptococcus, its main virulence determinant, is predominantly comprised of the polysaccharides glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) and galactoxylomannan (GalXM) and to a much lesser extent, &lt;1%, mannoproteins (MP) (reviewed in Zaragoza et al., 2009). Conjugate vaccines consisting of GXM combined to either tetanus toxoid (TT) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa exoprotein A (rEPA) induce high antibody titers (Devi et al., 1991; Casadevall et al., 1992), enhanced antifungal activity of murine and human phagocytes (Mukherjee et al., 1995c; Zhong and Pirofski, 1996, 1998) and conferred some protection against cryptococcosis in mice (Devi, 1996; Fleuridor et al., 1998; Nussbaum et al., 1999). Unfortunately, the profound suppressive effects on immune responses induced by cryptococcal polysaccharides and the highly variable immune responses observed in response to the intact GXM portion of the conjugate vaccine renders it an unlikely choice for future vaccine development (reviewed in Zaragoza et al., 2009; reviewed in Pirofski, 2001). A strategy using small peptide mimotopes (peptides which are able to induce antibodies that are capable of binding to the native antigen when administered as an immunogen) that mimic defined GXM epitopes was attempted to elicit protective antibody responses where using total GXM was unsuccessful. Zhang et al. described a peptide mimetic (P13) of GXM that was recognized by human anti-GXM antibodies (Zhang et al., 1997) and showed that vaccination with P13-protein conjugates in mice resulted in prolonged survival after a lethal C. neoformans challenge compared to controls (Fleuridor et al., 2001) or following establishment of a chronic infection (Datta et al., 2008). </p><p>Casadevall et al. developed a murine monoclonal antibody (MAb), 18B7, to C. neoformans polysaccharide that underwent phase I clinical studies in HIV+ patients with cryptococcal antigenemia (Casadevall et al., 1998). A modest reduction in serum cryptococcal antigen titers was observed in patients receiving singular doses of 1 and 2 mg/kg up to 10 weeks post-treatment before returning to baseline (Casadevall et al., 1998). To date, no follow-up clinical studies have been published. A new approach using MAb 18B7 currently being investigated in mice involves conjugation of the MAb to the therapeutic radioisotopes 188Rhenium or 213Bismuth (Dadachova et al., 2003; Bryan et al., 2010). Studies have shown that administration of radiolabeled MAb 18B7 to lethally infected mice results in prolonged survival, reduced organ fungal burden, and was a more effective therapy compared to mice treated with amphotericin B. Radioimmunotherapy can be applied using MAb derived against multiple pulmonary fungal pathogens and thus may evolve into an attractive option for the treatment of other pulmonary mycoses. Lastly, while most studies have examined passive administration with antibodies targeting C. neoformans polysaccharide, other cryptococcal targets for passive antibody therapy under experimental investigation include melanin (Rosas et al., 2001), ┚-glucan (Rachini et al., 2007), heat shock protein (HSP) 90 (Nooney et al., 2005) and glucosylceramide (Rodrigues et al., 2007). </p><p>Mice deficient in B cells, either due to a targeted disruption of the IgM constant region (µMT mice) or using depletion antibodies, are more susceptible to PcP infection (Harmsen and Stankiewicz, 1991; Marcotte et al., 1996) (Lund et al., 2003; Lund et al., 2006). These studies showed that B cells were able to provide protection against PcP not only by producing Ab but also by amplifying the CD4+ T cell-mediated immune response. Passive administration of an IgM mAb shown to be directed against a surface antigen present on rat-, rabbit-, ferret- , and human-derived P. carinii induced partial protection against PcP in animal models (Gigliotti and Hughes, 1988). Subsequent studies showed that the passive administration of mAbs recognizing kexin-like molecule (KEX1) via the intranasal route prior to experimentally induced PcP resulted in a significant reduction in pulmonary fungal burden (~99%) (Gigliotti et al., 2002). </p><p>Contrasting studies have shown that B cell deficient µMT mice have lower pulmonary fungal burden following intranasal infection with A. fumigatus (Montagnoli et al., 2003) or B. dermatitidis (Wuthrich et al., 2000) and are not more susceptible to experimental pulmonary histoplasmosis infection (Allendorfer et al., 1999) compared to WT controls. Also, passive transfer of polyclonal serum or MAbs obtained from A. fumigatus, B. dermatitidis, or C. immttis vaccinated mice did not enhance protection against a subsequent intranasal challenge with these pathogens (Kong et al., 1965; Beaman et al., 1977; Frosco et al., 1994; Wuthrich et al., 2000; Beaman et al., 1979). The role of antibodies in the host defense against fungal infection remains controversial because of its complexity. The current consensus is that antifungal antibodies can mediate protective, nonprotective, or disease-enhancing effects on host defenses during infection (Mukherjee et al., 1995a; Mukherjee et al., 1995b; Yuan et al., 1998a). Thus, resistance to disease may depend upon the proportion of protective antifungal antibodies produced during infection. In support of this concept, non-protective and protective MAbs to C. neoformans has been described (Mukherjee et al., 1995a; Maitta et al., 2004). Also, Nosanchuk et al. demonstrated that mice passively administered MAbs targeting a histone H2B-like protein on the surface of H. capsulatum before infection experienced a reduction in fungal burden and prolonged survival (Nosanchuk et al., 2003). These studies were somewhat surprising in light of previous studies showing no increased susceptibility to experimental histoplasmosis infection in B cell deficient mice (Allendorfer et al., 1999). Studies in C. neoformans has shown that the efficacy of MAbs appears to be dependent on several variables including host genetics (Rivera and Casadevall, 2005), Ab isotype (Yuan et al., 1995; Yuan et al., 1998b), T cell function (Yuan et al., 1997), and the presence of Th1- and Th2-related cytokines (Beenhouwer et al., 2001). AMI during the protective response to pulmonary fungal pathogens is broad and divergent, but it is clear that specific antibodies are efficacious for the host in the resolution of infection. </p><p>Studies also support the potential of using antibodies that target antigens common among multiple fungi to mediate cross-protection. Passive immunization using anti ┚-glucan MAbs or vaccination with ┚-glucan (laminarin) conjugated with the genetically-inactivated diphtheria toxin CRM197 (Lam-CRM vaccine) has been shown to confer protection against C. neoformans, C. albicans and A. fumigatus (Torosantucci et al., 2005; Rachini et al., 2007). Since ┚-glucans are found in the cell wall of fungi, the efficacy of anti-┚-glucan antibodies can be very broad. Cenci et al. used a killer anti-idiotype MAb reacting to a yeast killer toxin to protect mice from a lethal A. fumigatus challenge during experimental bone marrow transplantation (Cenci and Romani and 2375). Killer toxin is also expressed by multiple fungal species. Mycograb (NeuTec Pharman plc.), a recombinant antibody targeting an epitope within the HSP90 of Candida albicans that is conserved with the corresponding protein in C. neoformans, has been shown to act in adjunct with amphotericin B against multiple Candida species and C. neoformans. Altogether, these studies highlight the possibility that antibodies targeting \"universal' antigens common to multiple fungal species such as ┚-glucans, killer toxins, or Hsps may extend protection to multiple disparate fungal pathogens. Casadevall and Pirofski has published an elegant commentary on the emergence of cross-protective targets for fungi (Casadevall and Pirofski, 2007). </p><p>5. Conclusion </p><p>The principal route of entry for several of the primary and opportunistic fungal pathogens is via inhalation of infectious propagules into the lungs. Consequently, exposure to these fungi is unavoidable. Nevertheless, most encounters are asymptomatic due to the quick resolution of the fungi by resident effector cells within the lung. On those occasions that the fungal insult cannot be quickly eradicated, T cells, predominantly CD4+ T cells, preside over orchestrating the adaptive responses and provide help for antibody production. T cell responses are also influenced by cytokine production by innate effector cells. Nonetheless, T cells mediate various cellular responses at the sites of infection and are ultimately responsible for either resolution or pathological reactions associated with these infections. Furthermore, T cells are important players in homeostasis and protecting integrity of natural barriers. Recent advances in experimental animal models support the premise that antifungal vaccines may be effective in immune compromised hosts. The efficacy of anti-fungal vaccines in immune compromised populations is undoubtedly due to the inherent plasticity of host immunity. Altogether, it is clear that immune responses to pulmonary fungal infections are as diverse as the fungi themselves but that significant ground has been made towards its understanding. </p><p>6.

Caused by bacteria,viruses or fungi, respiratory infections require distinct knowledge of recent advances in pathogenesis. Progressin the understanding of immunopathogenesis of Acinetobacter baumannii infection will explain how an atypicalorganism establishes infection. The chapter regarding pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infections inthe State of Para depicts a unique study in an endemic region for tuberculosis in North of Brazil. The diagnosisand treatment of latent tuberculosis is a formidable challenge. Thus, new developments in diagnosis andtreatment of latent tuberculosis are included in this book. Challenging in their diagnosis, nontuberculousmycobacterial pulmonary diseases require special education for management. The problems of respiratoryinfections in the immunocompromised host are increasing in numbers and in resilience to treatment.Therefore, the chapter describing the host immune responses against pulmonary fungal pathogens comes asa necessary section in this book.

Introduction\n\nThe lungs are a gateway for numerous airborne pathogens that are ubiquitous in our environment. Among these potential pathogens are fungi that can be found in the soil, bird excreta, air ducts, and many other places where their contact is unavoidable. Exposure to these fungal pathogens oftentimes goes unnoticed due to the activation of our robust immune systems which sequester and control these microbes before significant damage occurs. Still, there are many situations in which host immunity becomes compromised providing an opportunity for typically innocuous fungal organisms to become established and cause disease or for dormant infections to reawaken. Also, in certain cases disease may be exacerbated due to an over exuberant immune response. In this chapter, we will review the main aspects of innate and adaptive immune responses against pulmonary fungal pathogens. We will also discuss the potential for vaccines to prevent pulmonary fungal infections.\n\n2. Introduction to pulmonary fungal infections\n\nPulmonary fungal infections can be grouped into primary fungal pathogens and opportunistic fungal pathogens. Those organisms that can cause disease in immune competent hosts are considered primary pathogens including Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, Paracoccidioides brasilensis, and Blastomyces dermatiditis. All of the primary pulmonary fungal pathogens are endemic to the United States and/or Central & South America. Histoplasma and Blastomyces are endemic to the Ohio River & Mississippi River Valleys of the United States and also to certain regions of Central and South America (Klein et al., 1986; Deepe, 2000). Coccidioides is prevalent in the desert southwest United States (Fisher et al., 2007), and Paracoccidioides is endemic in Central and South America, particularly in Brazil (Franco, 1987; Franco et al., 1989; Brummer et al., 1993). These\n\n* Corresponding Author infections are acquired by inhalation of fungi from contaminated soil, and severity of disease generally correlates with the amount of exposure to the pathogen.\n\nExamples of organisms that are opportunistic pulmonary fungal pathogens include Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Pneumocystis, and Rhizopus. C. neoformans is found ubiquitously in the soil, usually in soil contaminated with pigeon guano (Perfect and Casadevall, 2002). These fungi primarily cause disease in individuals with compromised immune systems. Most cryptococcal infections are asymptomatic, and the organism typically causes disease in immune compromised patients, such as AIDS patients, solid organ transplant patients on immune-suppressive drugs, or patients receiving chemotherapy (Levitz, 1991; Mitchell and Perfect, 1995; Singh et al., 1997; Shoham and Levitz, 2005). A. fumigatus is ubiquitously found in the environment, and is normally found in association with decaying wood and plant matter (Deacon et al., 2009). However, A. fumigatus can cause severe respiratory infections in cases of massive exposure or immune deficiency, such as neutropenia, due to chemotherapy, AIDS, or bone marrow transplant therapy (Denning, 1996; Almyroudis et al., 2005; Magill et al., 2008). Pneumocystis infection is acquired by inhalation of organisms from a yet unknown source (Keely et al., 1995; reviewed in Kelly and Shellito, 2010). Most Pneumocystis infections occur in immunosuppressed individuals due to either HIV or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Leigh et al., 1993; Nevez et al., 1999; Huang et al., 2003; Calderon et al., 1996; Morris et al., 2004; Norris et al., 2006; Davis et al., 2008; Morris et al., 2008a; Morris et al., 2008b; Kling et al., 2009). Similarly, infection with Rhizopus typically occurs in individuals who are immune compromised, such as organ transplant recipients (Kontoyiannis, 2010; Pappas et al., 2010).\n\n3. Innate immune responses against pulmonary fungal pathogens\n\n3.1 Phagocyte interactions with pulmonary fungal pathogens\n\nCells of the innate immune system such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages residing in the lungs/airways are the first line of defense against pulmonary fungal pathogens. Although these innate cells cannot completely eliminate many fungal pathogens, they are involved in uptake and degradation of fungi and processing of antigens derived from these pathogens. In contrast, neutrophils which are also phagocytic and can be fungistatic are unable to present antigen. Based on the subset of receptors involved and signaling pathways triggered by these receptors, the innate immune system will trigger different types of early responses and subsequently translate these signals to mount different types of adaptive responses.\n\nH. capsulatum can initially be engulfed by macrophages, DCs, and neutrophils (reviewed in (Deepe, 2005)), however, H. capsulatum recognition by different receptors results in different fates (Gomez et al., 2008). DCs recognize H. capsulatum by VLA-5, by interaction with an unknown receptor, which results in uptake, killing, and antigen presentation (Gildea et al., 2001; Gomez et al., 2008). Human DCs exert their antifungal activity via phagolysosomal fusion. The addition of suramin (which blocks phagolysosomal fusion) inhibits DC fungicidal activity, but inhibition of lysosomal acidification and inhibition of respiratory burst has no effect (Gildea et al., 2005). In contrast to DCs, macrophages recognize the H. capsulatum surface molecule heat-shock protein 60 (HSP 60) by LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18), complement receptor 3 (CD11b/CD18), and complement receptor 4 (CD11c/CD18) and this recognition leads to uptake and intracellular replication (Kimberlin et al., 1981; Bullock and Wright, 1987; Long et al., 2003; Gomez et al., 2008; Lin et al., 2010). However, activated macrophages can halt intracellular replication (Wu-Hsieh and Howard, 1984; Wu-Hsieh et al., 1984). H. capsulatum can avoid the macrophage lysosomal environment by preventing phagolysosomal fusion (Newman et al., 1997; Strasser et al., 1999) or by alkalinizing the pH of the phagolysosome (Eissenberg and Goldman, 1988; Eissenberg et al., 1988; Eissenberg et al., 1993). Macrophages infected with H. capsulatum and activated with GM-CSF decrease available iron and zinc, while infected macrophages without GM-CSF do not. Further, chelation of zinc inhibits yeast replication; therefore zinc deprivation may be used by macrophages in host defense against H. capsulatum (Winters et al., 2010). Neutrophil phagocytosis of H. capsulatum requires opsonization with either antibody or complement (Brummer et al., 1991; Kurita et al., 1991a; Kurita et al., 1991b; Newman et al., 1993). Neutrophil uptake of H. capsulatum is fungistatic, as opposed to macrophages (permissive growth & replication) and DCs (fungicidal) (reviewed in Deepe, 2005). A lack of neutrophils causes a non-lethal infection to become a lethal infection (Zhou et al., 1998).\n\nImmature DCs bind spherules of Coccidioides in a time and temperature-dependent manner, and binding is blocked by mannan, suggesting that mannose receptor (MR) is involved in this interaction (Dionne et al., 2006). Spherules of Coccidioides stimulate DC functional maturation, evidenced by decreased endocytic capacity and stimulation of allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cell activation (Dionne et al., 2006). Further studies showed that a DC-based Coccidioides vaccine had adjuvant properties and activated protective immune responses in mice (Awasthi, 2007). Although macrophages can ingest Coccidioides; earlier studies suggested that they are not able to kill the arthroconidia (Kashkin et al., 1977; Beaman et al., 1981, 1983; Beaman and Holmberg, 1980b, 1980a). Studies demonstrated that monocytes derived from human peripheral blood were able to kill Coccidioides (Ampel and Galgiani, 1991). Neutrophils are the earliest cell type to infiltrate upon pulmonary infection with Coccidioides arthroconidia (Savage and Madin, 1968). Phagocytosis by neutrophils is enhanced by the addition of immune serum (Drutz and Huppert, 1983; Wegner et al., 1972; Frey and Drutz, 1986). Uptake of Coccidioides arthroconidia by neutrophils induces a respiratory burst (Frey and Drutz, 1986), but less than 20% of the arthroconidia are killed (Frey and Drutz, 1986; Beaman and Holmberg, 1980b; Drutz and Huppert, 1983). The spherule form of Coccidioides cannot be phagocytosed by or killed by neutrophils (Frey and Drutz, 1986; Galgiani, 1986), but rupture of the spherule leads to an influx of neutrophils (Frey and Drutz, 1986).\n\nP. brasiliensis can be phagocytosed by immature DCs, and uptake is significantly decreased with the addition of mannan, suggesting that MR is the primary receptor for P. brasiliensis on DCs (Ferreira et al., 2004). After DC uptake of P. brasiliensis, the fungal organisms survive and multiply intracellularly rather than being killed (Ferreira et al., 2004). Following in vitro culture of P. brasiliensis or the major surface antigen gp43 with DCs, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II is downregulated as is the production of interleukin (IL)-12 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-• (Ferreira et al., 2004). However, in vivo studies showed that DC interaction with P. brasiliensis results in modification of DC receptor expression, including upregulation of CCR7, CD103, and MHC II and also induces migration of both pulmonary and bone marrow-derived DCs. DCs are also able to activate T helper cell responses in the draining lymph nodes following interaction with P. brasiliensis (Silvana dos Santos et al., 2011). Alveolar macrophages adhere to and internalize Paracoccidioides using the organism's phospholipase B, which also serves to downregulate macrophage activation (Soares et al., 2010). During pulmonary infection with P. brasiliensis, a shift in macrophage activation occurs, which is characterized by an increase in IL-1, TNF-•, and IL-6 (Silva et al., 2011). P. brasilensis can proliferate within macrophages, but macrophage activation inhibits its growth (Brummer et al., 1988; Cano et al., 1994). Further, macrophages activated by interferon (IFN)-• can kill P. brasiliensis (Cano et al., 1994; Gonzalez et al., 2000). In vitro stimulation of human monocytes and neutrophils with Paracoccidiodes yeast showed downregulation of toll-like receptor (TLR)2, TLR4, and dectin-1 on the surface of these cells. In addition, yeast cells induced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-• (Bonfim et al., 2009). Mice lacking TLR2 had a less severe pulmonary infection than wild-type (WT) mice and had decreased nitric oxide (NO) production. However, despite the differences in infection, both TLR2-/- mice and WT mice had similar rates of survival and similar pulmonary inflammatory responses (Loures et al., 2009). Further, TLR2 deficiency skewed the adaptive response towards a T helper (Th)17 phenotype and caused a decrease in T regulatory cells. Increased neutrophils and eosinophils migrate to the lungs of mice susceptible to P. brasiliensis, (Cano et al., 1995), and this influx affects the disease outcome and the adaptive response induced to infection. In susceptible individuals recovered from Paracoccidiodes, neutrophils are able to phagocytose the organism, but this leads to degeneration of the neutrophils. These data suggest that susceptible individuals have an inherent neutrophil deficiency (Dias et al., 2008). Further, neutrophils from patients with P. brasiliensis have a digestive defect against the fungus (Goihman-Yahr et al., 1980), and also have a killing defect against the fungus (Goihman-Yahr et al., 1985; Goihman-Yahr et al., 1992).\n\nB. dermatiditis interaction with DCs causes efficient upregulation of antigen presentation and costimulatory molecules and induces production of IL-12 and TNF-• (Wuthrich et al., 2006). DCs can activate CD8+ T cells in the absence of CD4+ T cells, and the yeast alone is a sufficient inflammatory stimulus that can directly induce maturation of DCs and can induce production of TNF-•, IL-1•, and IL-12 (Wuthrich et al., 2006). Monocyte-derived dendritic cells can associate with yeast in the lung and transport them to the draining lymph nodes, but fail to present antigen to CD4+ T cells, however dermal DCs are capable of antigen presentation (Ersland et al., 2010). During B. dermatiditis infection, alveolar macrophages are only modestly able to ingest and kill the yeast form of the organism (Bradsher et al., 1987). Murine macrophages are only able to kill less than 5% of yeast (Brummer and Stevens, 1987; Brummer et al., 1988), and had a 25-30% reduction in respiratory burst compared to the respiratory burst induced by zymosan. The Blastomyces adhesion 1 (BAD1) molecule on the Blastomyces yeast surface is responsible for binding to CD11b/CD18 and CD14 on the macrophage surface and subsequent entry (Klein et al., 1993; Newman et al., 1995). Neutrophils rapidly infiltrate to pulmonary tissues following infection, and are responsible for the formation of pyogranulomatous lesions. Conidia are rapidly phagocytosed by neutrophils, but killing of conidia is inefficient. Similar to macrophages, the neutrophil respiratory burst induced by conidia is only 70% of that induced by zymosan (Drutz and Frey, 1985). In addition, yeasts are even more difficult for the neutrophils to phagocytose & kill than conidia (Drutz and Frey, 1985).\n\nPneumocystis interacts with DCs in vitro by MR, (Kobayashi et al., 2007) but the interaction does not lead to an increase in maturation markers such as MHC II, CD40, CD54, CD80, or CD86. Additionally, this interaction induces the production of IL-4 but not IL-12p40, IL-10, TNF-•, or IL-6 (Kobayashi et al., 2007). However, Pneumocystis cell wall •-glucans have the ability to induce costimulatory molecule upregulation on DCs, such as MHC II, CD80, CD86, and CD40. These DCs interacted with •-glucans from Pneumocystis via dectin-1, and co-stimulatory molecule expression and Th1-type cytokine secretion by ┚-glucan stimulated DCs was regulated by Fas-Fas ligand interaction (Carmona et al., 2006). In vivo administration of DCs pulsed with Pneumocystis induced specific T cell responses and release of IL-4 as well as specific IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b production (Kobayashi et al., 2007). Alveolar macrophages have been shown to directly kill both Pneumocystis trophozoites and cysts (Fleury et al., 1985; reviewed in Kelly and Shellito, 2010). Specifically, alternatively-activated macrophages (aaMac) are important effector cells against Pneumocystis, and aaMac is enhanced by IL-33 (Nelson et al., 2011). In addition, Pneumocystis infection causes changes in gene expression of alveolar macrophages that included upregulation of genes involved in antigen presentation and antimicrobial peptides, but downregulation of genes involved in phagocytosis and uptake (Cheng et al., 2010). Pneumocystis major surface glycoprotein (MSG), which is a heavily glycosylated surface antigen, is recognized by MR on alveolar macrophages (Ezekowitz et al., 1991). Pneumocystis infection in HIV+ patients induces shedding of the MR, which results in reduced alveolar macrophage phagocytosis of the microbe (Koziel et al., 1998; Fraser et al., 2000). Neutrophils can also interact with Pneumocystis, but the presence of neutrophils is correlated with inflammation and increased severity of disease (reviewed in Kelly and Shellito, 2010).\n\nInhaled A. fumigatus conidia are first encountered by alveolar macrophages and neutrophils (reviewed in Hasenberg et al., 2011). Following uptake of Aspergillus by phagocytes, the organism enters the phagosome and killing occurs following phagosomal fusion with lysosomes, (Ibrahim-Granet et al., 2003). In the absence or impairment of phagocytic cells, there are dramatic increases in invasive Aspergillus infections (Latge, 1999). •-1,3 glucans of Aspergillus swollen conidia and hyphae are recognized by dectin-1 on the surface of alveolar macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils (Taylor et al., 2002; Taylor et al., 2007). This recognition of Aspergillus leads to phagocytosis and the production of cytokines such as TNF-•, IL-6, and IL-18 (Gersuk et al., 2006). In addition, Aspergillus can be recognized by TLRs, predominantly TLR2 and TLR4 (Wang et al., 2001; Mambula et al., 2002; Netea et al., 2002; Meier et al., 2003; Netea et al., 2003; Bellocchio et al., 2004; Bochud et al., 2008), but phagocytosis and uptake are not due to recognition by TLR2, TLR4, TLR9, or MyD88 (Bellocchio et al., 2004). More recent data also points to recognition of Aspergillus unmethylated DNA by TLR9 (Ramirez-Ortiz et al., 2008; Ramaprakash et al., 2009). Further, TLR9 is actively recruited to the Aspergillus phagosome and requires the N-terminal proteolytic cleavage domain for proper intracellular trafficking (Kasperkovitz et al., 2010).\n\nDCs bind and internalize A. fumigatus through DC-SIGN, and this binding triggers DC maturation (Serrano-Gomez et al., 2004). Mouse DCs can internalize conidia of A. fumigatus using MR and a C-type lectin receptor as well as Fc•R (Bozza et al., 2002). Upon exposure of DCs to A. fumigatus, DCs upregulate HLA-DR, CD80 and CD86 (Grazziutti et al., 2001; Bozza et al., 2002). Following A. fumigatus infection, DCs can release the chemokine CXCL8, which promotes migration of PMNs, can upregulate CCL19, which is important in migration of CCR7+ naïve T cells and mature DCs to lymph nodes, and can release soluble factors that increase CD11b and CD18 on PMNs (Gafa et al., 2007). DC phagocytosis of A. fumigatus conidia and hyphae occur by different means and through different receptors; conidia are phagocytosed by coiling phagocytosis and hyphae are phagocytosed by zipper-type phagocytosis (Bozza et al., 2002). A. fumigatus killing by DCs is dependent on phagolysosomal fusion and a reduction in pH (Ibrahim-Granet et al., 2003). Plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) have the ability to spread over A. fumigatus hyphae and inhibit their growth\n\n(Ramirez-Ortiz et al., 2011), and antifungal activity does not require direct cell contact. Following interaction of pDCs with Aspergillus, pDCs release pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-• and TNF-•, and these are produced via a TLR9-independent mechanism (Ramirez-Ortiz et al., 2011). During the early stages of Aspergillus infection, alternatively activated macrophages are recruited to the lung and are important in host defense (Bhatia et al., 2011). Studies examining the interaction of Aspergillus conidia with alveolar macrophages showed that infectivity and inhibition of macrophage killing by the fungus were due to the presence of a siderophore system that allows the fungus to acquire iron (Schrettl et al., 2010). In neutropenic mice, inflammatory DCs are recruited to the lungs during Aspergillus infection, and this recruitment is dependent on the absence of neutrophils (Park et al., 2010). This accumulation led to increased TNF-┙, CCL2, and CCL20, which resulted in further recruitment of inflammatory DCs. Neutrophils, when incubated with A. fumigatus hyphae, form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are antifungal, but mostly act in a fungistatic manner to limit spread of the hyphae (Bruns et al., 2010; Hasenberg et al., 2011).\n\nIn vitro studies of DCs with C. neoformans have shown that DCs are involved in detection, binding, phagocytosis, processing, antigen presentation, T cell activation, and killing of the organism (Bauman et al., 2000; Bauman et al., 2003; Wozniak et al., 2006; Wozniak and Levitz, 2008). DCs isolated from infected lungs presented cryptococcal mannoprotein (MP) to MP-specific T cells and induced T cell activation ex vivo (Wozniak et al., 2006). Depletion of DCs abrogated the T cell response (Mansour et al., 2006). Furthermore, DC phagocytosis of mannoprotein (MP) in the presence of the appropriate adjuvant induces production of Th1-type cytokines (Dan et al., 2008). Additional studies revealed that the interaction of C. neoformans with DCs, but not macrophages, induced the production of IL-12 and IL-23, two cytokines associated with protection against cryptococcosis (Kleinschek et al., 2010). Phagocytosis of encapsulated C. neoformans by DCs requires opsonization with either anti-capsular antibody or complement, and the combination of these has an additive effect (Kelly et al., 2005). Also, both murine and human DCs are able to kill C. neoformans, by both oxidative and non-oxidative mechanisms (Kelly et al., 2005). Recognition and uptake of acapsular C. neoformans strains by DCs requires MR and Fc•R II (Syme et al., 2002). TLR2 and TLR4 are not important in uptake of C. neoformans or activation of DCs by the fungus (Nakamura et al., 2006). DCs stimulated with DNA from C. neoformans release IL-12p40 and express CD40, a costimulatory molecule associated with DC maturation, and thus was tied to recognition by TLR9 (Nakamura et al., 2008). Upon infection with C. neoformans, CCR2-deficient mice, which are impaired in trafficking of monocyte-derived DCs, developed a non-protective Th2-type immune response and persistent infection, and had reduced DC recruitment, bronchovascular collagen deposition, and increased IL-4 production (Osterholzer et al., 2008). C. neoformans can also be phagocytosed by macrophages (Levitz et al., 1999; Del Poeta, 2004). Macrophage phenotypes are associated with differential immune responses against C. neoformans. Protection against infection is associated with the presence of classically-activated macrophages (caMac) (Zhang et al., 2009; Hardison et al., 2010a; Hardison et al., 2010b), while disease progression is associated with the presence of alternatively activated macrophages (aaMac) (Arora et al., 2005; Muller et al., 2007; Arora et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2007; Guerrero et al., 2010). Also, macrophages can serve as a site of replication of C. neoformans (Tucker and Casadevall, 2002). Intracellular replication rates within macrophages correlated to virulence for C. neoformans strains (Voelz et al., 2009). In addition to replication, yeasts can be expulsed from macrophages by a non-lytic mechanism that leaves both C. neoformans and macrophages intact and capable of replication and growth (Alvarez and Casadevall, 2006; Ma et al., 2006; Alvarez and Casadevall, 2007; Johnston and May, 2010). C. neoformans can also be phagocytosed by activated neutrophils (Kozel et al., 1987). The capsule of C. neoformans induces neutrophils to release proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1•, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-• (Retini et al., 1996). Neutrophils can kill C. neoformans by non-oxidative mechanisms, including neutrophil defensins and calprotectin (Mambula et al., 2000). Interestingly, induction of neutropenia in mouse models of infection reduces their susceptibility to infection (Mednick et al., 2003).\n\nAlthough innate immune responses against Rhizopus, the main causative agent of mucormycosis, have not yet been fully characterized, recent work has shown that Rhizopus can trigger a common innate sensing pathway in DCs that leads to the production of IL-23 and drives Th17-type responses (Chamilos et al., 2010). This is due to interaction of dectin -1 with •-glucans on the surface of Rhizopus hyphae.\n\n3.2 NK cell activity\n\nAnother innate immune response to pulmonary fungal pathogens is due to recognition and action by natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells were thought to act primarily against viruses and tumors, but more recent studies have shown that NK cells have a wide variety of functions against bacteria, fungi, and parasites (Newman and Riley, 2007).\n\nIn H. capsulatum infection, there is little evidence of a protective role for NK cells. While beige mice (lacking functional NK cells) are more susceptible to H. capsulatum infection, T cells play a greater role in controlling infection (Patino et al., 1987). In studies evaluating both beige mice and mice depleted of NK cells, beige mice were still more susceptible to infection, while mice depleted of NK cells were no more susceptible to infection than WT mice, therefore indicating no major role for NK cells in protection (Suchyta et al., 1988). However, mice deficient in perforin, a major component of NK cell anti-microbial activity, had accelerated mortality and increased fungal burden (Zhou et al., 2001). Infection with Coccidioides during depletion of NK cells leads to increased susceptibility to infection (Petkus and Baum, 1987). Furthermore, NK cells have a direct cytotoxic effect on Coccidioides young spherule and endospore cells (Petkus and Baum, 1987). In Paracoccidioides, studies have shown increased NK cell activity in infected hamsters compared to uninfected controls. Impaired NK cell activity was associated with a decrease in cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and an increase in histopathologic lesions. However, after initial activation, NK cells alone were not able to control dissemination of Paracoccidiodes (Peracoli et al., 1995). In vitro NK cell activity correlated with growth inhibition of Paracoccidiodes yeast (Jimenez and Murphy, 1984).\n\nIn neutropenic mice with A. fumigatus infection, NK cells are the major cell type responsible for the production of IFN-• early in the infection. Additionally, depletion of NK cells reduces IFN-• levels and caused increased pulmonary fungal load (Park et al., 2009). NK cells have direct anti-fungal activity against hyphae but not against resting conidia (Schmidt et al., 2011). Killing is due to production of mediators by NK cells, including perforin. However, A. fumigatus can also down-regulate some cytokines induced by the NK cells, including IFN-• and GM-CSF (Schmidt et al., 2011). In addition, recruitment of NK cells to the lung during A. fumigatus infection by the chemokine MCP-1 is required for optimal clearance of the organism from the lungs (Morrison et al., 2003). During Pneumocystis infection in SCID mice (lacking T and B cells), NK cells were responsible for production of cytokines such as IFN-•, TNF-•, TNF-•, IL-10, and IL-12 (Warschkau et al., 1998). Recent studies have shown that NK cells are recruited to the lung during Pneumocystis infection and are important in fungal clearance of murine PCP (M. Kelly and J. Shellito, personal communication). Further, combined depletion of NK and CD4+ T cells resulted in increased pulmonary fungal burden compared to individual depletion of each subset. In vitro, NK cells have direct microbicidal activity against Pneumocystis, and this anti-fungal activity is significantly enhanced in the presence of CD4+ T cells, suggesting that both cell types are necessary for a protective response against Pneumocystis infection (M. Kelly and J. Shellito, personal communication). Early studies showed that NK cells can directly kill C. neoformans (Murphy and McDaniel, 1982). Further, IFN-• production by NK cells enhances elimination of the fungus in murine models (Kawakami et al., 2001a; Kawakami et al., 2001b; Kawakami et al., 2001c). Depletion of NK cells using anti-asialo GM antibody resulted in increased fungal burden in mice (Hidore et al., 1991a; Hidore et al., 1991b). Increased fungal burden was seen in beige mice compared to wild-type mice, and in mice depleted of NK1.1+ NK cells, fungal burden was also increased compared to controls (Lipscomb et al., 1987; Salkowski and Balish, 1991). Human NK cells kill C. neoformans (Levitz and Dupont, 1993), and this killing is enhanced in the presence of anti-cryptococcal antibodies (Miller et al., 1990). Binding of NK cells is required for cryptococcal killing, and requires disulfide bonds and is dependent on magnesium (Nabavi and Murphy, 1985; Hidore and Murphy, 1989; Murphy et al., 1991). Killing of C. neoformans is due to perforin interaction with the organism (Ma et al., 2004; Marr et al., 2009). In summary, NK cells act as accessory cells in antifungal host defenses contributing to clearance of fungi by a variety of mechanisms.\n\n3.3 Gamma/delta T cell activity\n\nThe role of gamma delta (••) T cells during the immune response to pulmonary fungal pathogens is diverse. During infection with Cryptococcus, mice genetically deficient or depleted in •• T cells have reduced fungal burden compared to controls. Further, mice lacking •••T cells had increased levels of IFN-• and decreased levels of TGF-• compared to controls, therefore suggesting that •••T cells are detrimental to protective immunity during cryptococcal infection (Uezu et al., 2004). In Pneumocystis pneumonia, CD4+ T cells are necessary for protection against infection, but •• cells are known to infiltrate into the lung during pneumonia (Kagi et al., 1993; Agostini et al., 1995; Steele et al., 2002). However, resolution of pulmonary Pneumocystis infection is augmented in •• T cell-deficient mice, (Steele et al., 2002), suggesting that these cells are detrimental to clearance of the organism. Further, the absence of •• T cells led to an increase in recruitment of CD8+ T cells and production of cytokines such as IFN-•. Complete lack of all T cell subsets (•• and ••) during\n\nPneumocystis infection led to lethal consequences (Hanano and Kaufmann, 1999). Thus, •••••cells have•either a limited •role in antifungal protection or are detrimental to antifungal\n\nhost defenses.\n\n3.4 Innate anti-fungal defenses by non-immune cells\n\nWhile innate immune cells and components of the innate immune system are the predominant innate immune defenses, it has also been shown that unconventional cells, such as epithelial cells can also play a role in anti-fungal innate host responses. Airway epithelial cells are capable of uptake and processing of antigens and initiation of Th-type immune responses (Gereke et al., 2009). P. brasiliensis interacts with and can be internalized by bronchial epithelial cells (Mendes-Giannini et al., 1994, and this internalization is due to activation of a tyrosine kinase pathway (Monteiro da Silva et al., 2007; Hanna et al., 2000). In addition, uptake of P. brasiliensis causes both cytoskeletal rearrangements as well as apoptosis of the epithelial cells (Mendes-Giannini et al., 2004). C. neoformans can bind to pulmonary epithelial cells by a mechanism believed to be due to carbohydrate moieties that can be a ligand for the yeast (Merkel and Scofield, 1997). C. neoformans interaction with bronchial epithelial cells causes the production of IL-8, but epithelial cells are also susceptible to damage by the organism (Guillot et al., 2008a). In A. fumigatus infection, conidia can be taken up by tracheal epithelial cells, alveolar type II cells, and endothelial cells (Paris et al., 1997). Further, cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 are released by epithelial cells in vitro following stimulation with A. fumigatus proteases (Borger et al., 1999) or by A. fumigatus hyphal fragments (Zhang et al., 2005) and nasal epithelium. And nasal epithelium can engulf A. fumigatus conidia (Botterel et al., 2008). Epithelial cells can also release antimicrobial peptides following stimulation with fungal organisms. Epithelial cells in vitro cultured with A. fumigatus conidia, swollen conidia, or hyphae produced large amounts of beta defensins (Alekseeva et al., 2009). Airway epithelial cells internalize A. fumigatus conidia, and a genome-wide analysis revealed differential gene expression in epithelial cells with conidia compared to cells without conidia. Genes that were upregulated with conidia included genes involved in repair and inflammation, such as matrix metalloproteinases and chemokines (Gomez et al., 2010). In Pneumocystis, several studies have shown that the organism interacts with pulmonary epithelial cells. The interaction of Pneumocystis with epithelial cells was shown to be one of the initial steps in infection (Lanken et al., 1980; Yoneda and Walzer, 1980; Long et al., 1986; Millard et al., 1990). The •-glucan from the Pneumocystis cell wall can stimulate pulmonary epithelial cells to produce IL-8, and the organism can induce the production of MCP-1 and ICAM -1 (Yu and Limper, 1997; Evans et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2007; Carmona et al., 2010). Interaction of Pneumocystis and alveolar epithelial cells also leads to the production of the chemokine MIP-2 following NF-•B signaling (Evans et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2005). These studies show that non-immune cells, such as epithelial cells, play a role in pulmonary anti-fungal immunity.\n\n4. T cell and antibody mediated immune responses to fungal infections\n\n4.1 Adaptive responses against pulmonary fungal pathogens\n\nWhen challenged with pathogenic fungi, the adaptive immune system is capable of mounting an effective response against most fungal species to eliminate fungal infections and maintain immunological memory that prevents their reoccurrence. However, fungi are ubiquitous in the host's environment including the saprophytes and opportunists that survive on the host's body surfaces and thus, the adaptive immune system is constantly challenged by fungal antigens. Excessive response to these antigens could lead to allergic responses or other types of immunopathological reactions. The balance between day-to-day fungal antigen exposure and the immune system is thought to lead to a homeostatic state defined as protective tolerance. Protective tolerance allows the host to keep possible fungal pathogens \"in check\" while preserving integrity of the natural barriers, which are potential portals for fungal infections (Romani and Puccetti, 2008; de Luca et al., 2010a; Littman and Rudensky, 2010).\n\nT cells are responsible for orchestration of adaptive immune responses and T cell derived signals produced in response to specific antigens lead to targeted expansion, recruitment, activation of leukocytes, and regulation of B cell antibody responses. T cells also serve as a pool of immunological memory. Additionally, T cells have been shown to directly act as the fungicidal effector cells and serve as regulators of inflammatory responses, contributing to the development and maintenance of the protective tolerance. These regulatory mechanisms are designed to limit the damage that the host immune system can inflict on host tissues during incorrect and/or excessive host responses. Thus, properly functioning T cells are responsible for building up protective immunity against fungal pathogens and play an essential role in maintaining normal homeostasis of the immune system in the context of normal presence of fungal antigens.\n\n4.2 CD4 + and CD8 + T cell mediated immunity\n\nThe importance of T cells in antifungal protection is well documented. T-cell deficient individuals show diminished resistance to fungal infections including coccidiomycosis (Kappe et al., 1998) cryptococcosis (Kovacs et al., 1985; Chuck and Sande, 1989; Spitzer et al., 1993; Jarvis and Harrison, 2007), histoplamosis (Odio et al., 1999), pneumocystis pneumonia (Kelly and Shellito), Paracoccidioides (Bava et al., 1991; Brummer et al., 1993), as well as pulmonary aspergillosis (Mylonakis et al., 1998). Likewise, laboratory studies have shown a strong contribution and/or requirement of T cells for protection against most pathogenic fungi such as Coccidioides (Fierer et al., 2006), Cryptococcus (Lim and Murphy, 1980; Mody et al., 1990; Huffnagle et al., 1991; Huffnagle and Lipscomb, 1992; Mody et al., 1994), Pneumocystis (Harmsen and Stankiewicz, 1990), Histoplasma (Deepe et al., 1984), Paracoccidioides (Cano et al., 2000) and Aspergillus (Cenci et al., 1997). These epidemiological and experimental studies have established that T cells are an important component of the antifungal host resistance.\n\nBoth subsets of T lymphocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ cells, are involved in antifungal host defenses. CD4+ T cells classically represent the T helper cell population. The T helper function was defined by MHC II restricted antigen specific activation of B-cell clones needed for the generation of specific antibodies. The CD4+ cell function in cell-mediated immunity (CMI) likewise requires antigen presenting cells and MHC II restricted antigen presentation. Presentation of antigen to the reactive T cells by dendritic cells and/or macrophages results in cytokine production. Through generation of different cytokine spectra, CD4+ T cells orchestrate recruitment and activation of various leukocyte subsets. The cytokines produced by the effector T cells are essential for macrophage fungicidal function and granuloma formation, but also may support chronic inflammation and immunopathology (Arora et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2008; Jain et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Thus, cytokine induction by differentially polarized T-cell lineages is the major determinant for fungicidal potential of distal effector cells. Although the effector CD4+ cell function relies predominantly on cytokine production, CD4+ T-cells are capable of fungal killing via direct cell contact. At least in some biological circumstances, the direct fungicidal effect of CD4+ T cells relies on granulysin as the fungicidal mediator (Zheng et al., 2007; Zheng et al., 2008).\n\nIn contrast with CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells are classically viewed as cytotoxic lymphocytes. These cells respond to antigen presentation in the context of MHC I, to enable their cytotoxic machinery. Such cytotoxic responses are particularly crucial in responses to viral infection and tumor cells, leading to elimination of the virally infected or tumor-transformed cells by cytotoxic lymphocytes. CD8+ cells also play an important role in host defenses to bacterial, parasitic and fungal infections (Oykhman and Mody, 2010). Numerous studies showed that CD8+ T cells significantly contribute to protection against Cryptococcus, Pneumocystis, Histoplasma and Blastomyces, even in the absence of CD4+ T cells. Depending on the type and virulence of the fungal pathogen, CD8+ cells could afford either partial or a complete protection against the major fungal pathogens in experimental models. In this context, CD8+ T cells could induce all the protective effector functions of CD4+ T cells including production of protective cytokines. Another important aspect of CD8+ T cell effector function is the direct fungicidal effect of CD8+ T cells. Such direct fungicidal activity of CD8+ T cells have been demonstrated for C. neoformans (Ma et al., 2002). The killing of C. neoformans requires direct cell contact; it is enhanced by IL-15 and is thought to be mediated by granulysin. The direct cytotoxic effects are most pronounced when lymphocytes from fungus-immunized mice are used, however, a relatively high rate of binding of T cells to the fungus suggests that these cytotoxic mechanisms are innate rather than adaptive.\n\n4.3 Immune polarization in antifungal host defenses\n\nT helper cell subsets characterized by differential cytokine production by differentially programmed T-cell lineages were initially defined as Th1 and Th2 (Mosmann et al., 1986; Cherwinski et al., 1987). The types of immune responses driven by each of these cell lineages are described as Th1 and Th2 immune responses, generate different types of immune effector responses, and show different spectra of effectiveness against different classes of pathogens. For effective control/clearance of the majority of fungal pathogens, Th1 is the required type of the immune response. The Th1 response is promoted by IL-12, IFN-┛, and TNF-┙. The two latter cytokines are also the major products of Th1 helper T cells (Cherwinski et al., 1987). Th1-type T-cells are responsible for the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions and CMI associated with vigorous proinflammatory responses and granuloma formation (Cher and Mosmann, 1987) and induction of IgG2a class antibodies in B cells (Stevens et al., 1988). The Th2 immune response is characterized by T-cell production of IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-13 (Cherwinski et al., 1987), IgG1 and IgE antibody production by B cells (Stevens et al., 1988) and the presence of eosinophilic inflammation (Huffnagle et al., 1994; Cenci et al., 1999; Olszewski et al., 2001). The Th1 and Th2 responses counter-regulate each other predominantly via an IL-4/IFN-┛ negative feedback loop (Fernandez-Botran et al., 1988; Gajewski and Fitch, 1988); however other cytokines can be also involved in Th1/Th2 regulation. The oversimplified Th1/Th2 paradigm has further evolved as new T cell lineages were defined. Th17 and regulatory type T cells (Treg), are T-cell lineages that are distinct from Th1 and Th2 cells that possess distinct functions in host defenses. Th17 cells are generated following the priming with IL-6 and TGF-┚ and sustained by the presence of IL-23. Th17 cells classically produce IL-17 and IL-22, however, a subset of Th17 cells can produce IFN-┛. Regulatory T-cells are thought to be responsible for tolerance that prevents autoimmune diseases and to contribute to resolution of inflammatory responses. These effects of Tregs are thought to be mediated by anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-┚, which are signature cytokines for Treg cells. New Th-cell lineages continue to be described including Th22 (Eyerich et al., 2009; Fujita et al., 2009) and Th9 (Soroosh and Doherty, 2009). Just like CD4+ effector T-cells, CD8+ T cells can also display a polarization pattern and thus can be an important source of the polarizing cytokines. Thus, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells contribute to the cytokine balance during the immune response (Huffnagle et al., 1994).\n\n4.4 Th1/2/17/22 cytokine responses\n\nThe protective role of Th1 along with the requirement of type 1 cytokines for fungal clearance have been demonstrated in models of cryptococcosis (Huffnagle et al., 1994; Kawakami et al., 1997; Blackstock et al., 1999; Abe et al., 2000; Traynor et al., 2000; Olszewski et al., 2001; Herring et al., 2002; Arora et al., 2005; Hernandez et al., 2005; Lindell et al., 2006; Wormley et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2008; Guillot et al., 2008b; Jain et al., 2009; Wozniak et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009), Coccidioides (Silva and Benitez, 2005), Paracocidioides (Cano et al., 1998), Histoplama (Zhou et al., 1995; Deepe and Gibbons, 2006) and Blastomyces (Brummer et al., 2006) infections. Th1 skewing is beneficial for clearance of Aspergillus (Cenci et al., 1997), although clearance of the filamentous fungi is mainly a domain of the innate immune system. The Th1 cytokine environment promotes clearance of fungi by supporting the classical activation of macrophages (Mantovani et al., 2001). Pathogenic fungi possess mechanisms that interfere with their recognition by macrophages. These fungi can survive within macrophage unless additional \"external\" stimulation occurs to activate fungicidal mechanisms. Such stimulation can be provided by Th1-type cytokines, especially IFN-┛ (Arora et al., 2005; Hardison et al.). In the context of a Th1 immune response, macrophages become classically activated and abundantly generate fungicidal molecules such as nitric oxide produced by nitric oxide synthase, an enzyme that utilizes L-arginine. Importance of classical macrophage activation and production of nitric oxide for fungal clearance has been demonstrated for Blastomyces (Brummer et al., 2005; Kethineni et al., 2006), Cryptococcus (Granger et al., 1990; Alspaugh and Granger, 1991; Rivera et al., 2002; Arora et al., 2005; Zhang et al.; Hardison et al.), Histoplasma (Zhou et al., 1995; Allendoerfer and Deepe, 1998; Allen and Deepe, 2006) and Paracocidiodes (Moreira et al.; Pinzan et al.) infections. The deficiencies in cytokines that support classical activation of macrophages GM-CSF, IFN-┛, TNF-┙, IL-12 are generally associated with the development of progressive fungal infection (Romani et al., 1994; Kawakami et al., 1999; Rayhane et al., 1999; Herring et al., 2005; Deepe and Gibbons, 2006) consistent with the general conclusion that Th1-type immune responses and type 1 cytokines are most optimal for resistance against fungal infections.\n\nUnlike Th1-type responses, the Th2 response is non-protective and frequently results in pathological responses to fungal challenges. For most fungal species, Th2 responses and type 2 cytokines decrease clearance of fungus. This is attributed to: 1) a suppression of protective Th1 responses due to a mutual counterregulatory feedback loop (Cenci et al., 1999) and 2) a generation of alternatively activated macrophages that can harbor fungal organisms (Arora et al., 2005; Jain et al., 2009; Osterholzer et al., 2009a; Zhang et al., 2009). Th2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-13 are the major trigger of alternative activation of macrophages (Arora et al., 2005; Jain et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). These alternatively activated macrophages do not express nitric oxide synthase but induce arginase which metabolizes L-arginine without yielding fungicidal nitric oxide. In the Th2 biased experimental models of fungal infections, intracellular survival of fungus within macrophages parallels high induction of alternatively activated macrophage markers (Arora et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2009; Hardison et al.).\n\nIncreased production of Th2-type cytokines has been associated with increased susceptibility to Cryptococcus (Arora et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2009; Hardison et al.) and Paracoccidioides (Ruas et al., 2009) infections and to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (Cenci et al., 1997; Cenci et al., 1999). Fungus-triggered Th2-type responses in the respiratory system may also lead to allergic diseases such rhinitis/sinusitis, asthma, allergic bronchopulmonary mycosis. Th2 type responses are highly detrimental to the respiratory system by promoting mucus hypersecretion/goblet cell metaplasia, eosinophilic inflammation, and peribronchial fibrosis all of which contribute to impaired airway function. Cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 are the major triggers of these pathologies as increased expression of these cytokines can be reproduced along with the allergic symptoms in the lungs challenged with fungi or their antigenic components (Blease et al., 2000; Arora et al., 2005; Jain et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Some of the fungal antigens can directly promote Th2 skewing. The secreted protein fraction from Aspergillus fumigatus promotes Th2 bias of the immune response (Bozza et al., 2009). Th2 pathologies are also found in mouse models of C. neoformans infections (Abe et al., 2000; Jain et al., 2009; Osterholzer et al., 2009b) (Figure 1). Expression of enzymes phospholipase B and urease by C. neoformans promote Th2 bias in the infected mice (Noverr et al., 2003; Osterholzer et al., 2009b). While Th2-biased responses are clearly undesirable in most types of fungal infections the exception is Pneumocystis infection, in which the Th2 response can contribute to fungal clearance (Shellito et al., 2000; McKinley et al., 2006; Hu et al., 2009).\n\nFig. 1. Classical versus alternative activation of macrophages during pulmonary infection with C. neoformans. A) Classically activated macrophages upregulate fungicidal mechanisms that eliminate ingested fungi. Note that ingested intracellular organisms show signs of degradation. B) Alternatively activated macrophages (AAM) harbor the ingested fungi. Note the abundant capsule formation (evidence of fungal metabolic activity) and dividing organisms (evidence of intracellular growth) within AAM. Alternative activation of macrophages is associated with crystallization of chitinase family proteins YM1 and YM2, a hallmark of AAM-induced pathology. V-vacuoles with the remnants of destroyed organisms, YM- YM1/YM2 crystals, C.n. - intact cryptococcal organisms.\n\nThe effects of Th17 responses and the IL-17 cytokine family in anti-fungal host responses may be protective or non-protective depending on fungal species and sites of infection (Figure 2). Thus, Th17 responses may be beneficial for some types of fungal infections or\n\nFig. 2. Th polarization in antifungal host defenses. The outcome of Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg polarization results from balance between Th lineages which can mutually regulate each other via cytokine feedback loops. Resultant outcome can either promote clearance of the fungal infection or result in persistent infection and limited or severe pathology. Th1 response promotes control of most fungal infections; Th2 leads to severe pathology and fungal persistence; Th17 may support clearance or persistence of different fungal infections, but may promote chronic neutrophilic inflammation. Treg may limit pathology by promoting resolution of the inflammatory response, but may increase the risk of persistence. Correct balance between Th1 and Treg is thought to support protective tolerance.\n\nexhibit detrimental effects. In the H. capsulatum infection model, IL-17 neutralization increases pulmonary fungal burden in connection with increased Treg numbers, suggesting that Th17 is beneficial for clearance of Histoplasma (Kroetz and Deepe, 2010). Th17 responses also contribute to anticryptococcal protection and the development of the protective inflammatory response in C. neoformans infected lungs (Zhang et al., 2009; Hardison et al., 2010b; Wozniak et al., 2011a).\n\nThe IL-23/IL-17 axis contributes to clearance of Pneumocystis (Rudner et al., 2007). However, in IFN-┛ deficient mice infected with Pneumocystis the development of strong Th17 response is detrimental, suggesting that a balance between IFN-┛ and IL-17 is needed for optimal clearance of Pneumocystis (Hu et al., 2009). At other mucosal sites, the effects of Th17 are variable. Th17 cells and IL-17 receptor signaling are required for mucosal host defenses in oral candidiasis (Conti et al., 2009); whereas Th17 impairs antifungal resistance and promotes inflammation in gastric infection model (Zelante et al., 2007). Th17 responses impair antifungal resistance and promotes inflammatory damage in the lungs of mice infected with Aspergillus (Zelante et al., 2007; Bozza et al., 2009; D'Angelo et al., 2009).\n\nOverall, the Th17 response may have beneficial effects for clearance of some fungal pathogens; however it also has high potential to produce undesirable effects, including inflammatory damage.\n\nExcessive immune reaction and uncontrolled inflammation can result in serious damage of the inflicted organs and tissues. Anti-inflammatory or regulatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-┚ are an important part of the balance which prevents over exuberant inflammation during acute responses. These cytokines are also thought to be important components of resolution and tissue repair that occurs after elimination of the pathogen. Regulatory T cells are important sources of these cytokines and their role in inflammatory diseases and in the maintenance of healthy tissue homeostasis becomes increasingly appreciated (Romani and Puccetti, 2008; De Luca et al., 2010b; Littman and Rudensky, 2010). The importance of balance between pro-inflammatory processes and Treg cell regulation has recently been demonstrated in models of Pneumocystis (McKinley et al., 2006) and Histoplasma infections (Kroetz and Deepe). The excessive/damaging inflammatory reaction can be exemplified by immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). IRIS is characterized by uncontrolled inflammatory responses with high induction of IFN-┛, TNF-┙ and other pro-inflammatory cytokines (Mori and Levin, 2009). Overproduction of these cytokines, rather than having protective effects, contributes to tissue injury that leads to worsening of the patient condition and high mortality (Mori and Levin, 2009). Interestingly, occurrence of IRIS in HIV patients who undergo antiretroviral therapy is particularly high in patients with Cryptococcus and Pneumocystis infections (Singh et al., 2005; Singh and Perfect, 2007; Murdoch et al., 2008). The mechanism of inadequate inflammatory response in IRIS is not understood, however it has been proposed that the regulatory mechanisms that control the inflammation, including Tregs are not sufficiently mobilized to put a break on this inflammatory response (McKinley et al., 2006; Shankar et al., 2008). In fact, patients with IRIS showed reduced suppressor function and diminished secretion of anti-inflammatory IL-10 by Tregs in one of the studies (Seddiki et al., 2009). Tregs are critical for maintaining the proper homeostasis in the GI track, and such mechanisms of protective tolerance are likely to be critical in the respiratory tract which is constantly exposed to inhaled fungal antigens. Insufficiency of the regulatory mechanisms most likely contributes to the development of allergic diseases. Thus, Tregs cells are important for maintaining balance between appropriate clearance rate and the inflammatory tissue damage. Such balance can be disturbed and the excessive Treg function may promote fungal persistence. A detrimental role of IL-10 has been demonstrated in cryptococcal infection models (Blackstock et al., 1999; Arora et al., 2005). Future studies will be needed to evaluate the possible role of Tregs in fungal infections, especially in the patients who develop mycoses without apparent immunodeficiency.\n\nThe polarization of T cells to Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg lineages is important for the development of protective immunity, protective tolerance, chronic/allergic syndromes, or overwhelming allergic reactions. The proper balance maintained by the mutual regulation between these arms of the immune system is necessary to optimize clearance and minimize inflammatory damage to the infected tissues in the context of fungal infection. Our present understanding of these responses evolved from an oversimplified polarized Th1/Th2 paradigm to a broader understanding of mutual regulation ongoing during the immune process. Recent studies show that the Th1, Th2, Th17 responses co-exist in a fungus infected lungs and the balance of cytokine production alters during different time points in a chronic fungal infection (Arora et al., 2011). Modulation of these responses can be achieved experimentally and therapeutically by use of cytokines and vaccination with different fractions of fungal antigens resulting in the induction of the proper and protective Th-cell polarization.\n\n4.5 Vaccine-induced therapies targeting cellular mediated immunity\n\nCurrently, there are no standardized vaccines available for the prevention of fungal diseases in humans (as discussed earlier). A preponderance of evidence points to the development of cell-mediated immune responses, principally by Th1-type CD4+ T cells, as the predominant host defense mechanism against primary and opportunistic pulmonary fungal pathogens (Cutler et al., 2007). Further, ablation or neutralization of several Th1-type cytokines renders mice more susceptible to experimental infection with a number of fungal pathogens. Consequently, there has been great interest in identifying antigens that elicit protective CMI against fungal infections; some of which will be discussed herein.\n\nVaccination with native or recombinant Hsp60 from H. capsulatum or a domain within Hsp60 conferred protection in mice given a sub-lethal challenge with yeast cells and prolonged survival in mice given a lethal challenge (Gomez et al., 1995; Deepe and Gibbons, 2002). Protection was CD4+ T cell dependent and associated with the induction of IFN-┛, IL-12 and, surprisingly, the Th2-type cytokine IL-10 (Deepe and Gibbons, 2002; Scheckelhoff and Deepe, 2005). A similar vaccination strategy in mice using Hsp70 did not induce robust IL-12 or IFN-┛ responses and protection against subsequent challenge with live yeast. Neutralization of IL-12 or IFN-┛ abolished the protective efficacy of the Hsp60 vaccine in mice further highlighting the importance of these Th1-type cytokines in the induction of protection against H. capsulatum.\n\nSimilarly, vaccination of mice with recombinant Hsp60 derived from P. brasiliensis elicited protection against a lethal intranasal challenge with yeast (de Bastos Ascenco Soares et al., 2008). The protective effect of P. basiliensis Hsp60 was abrogated following the depletion of CD4+ T cells or neutralization of IFN-┛; similar to that observed for Hsp60 from H. capsulatum (Scheckelhoff and Deepe, 2005; de Bastos Ascenco Soares et al., 2008). However, IL-10 was not produced following antigen stimulation of splenocytes obtained from P. basiliensis Hsp60 immunized mice. While the efficacy of vaccination with forms of Hsp60 from H. capsulatum and P. brasiliensis are encouraging, immunization with recombinant Hsp60 derived from C. immitis resulted in predominantly Th2 cytokine responses and little protection against a subsequent intraperitoneal challenge (Li et al., 2001). Thus, the induction of Th1-type immune responses in the lungs appears critical for the development of protection following immunization with Hsp60.\n\nEvaluation of live attenuated, recombinant, and DNA vaccines of C. immitis in murine models have also highlighted the importance of Th1-type cytokine production, particularly IFN-┛, in protection against this microbe (reviewed in (Cole et al., 2004; Cox and Magee, 2004; Xue et al., 2009)). Mice immunized with recombinant aspartyl protease (Pep1), alpha-mannosidase (Amn1), or phospholipase B (Plb) individually or together as amultivalent vaccine experienced a significant reduction in fungal burden and prolonged survival against a lethal pulmonary challenge with C. posadasii arthroconidia compared to controls (Tarcha et al., 2006). Approximately 85% of mice immunized with the multivalent recombinant vaccine survived to day 90 post-inoculation. Similarly, immunization of mice with two recombinant antigens, Coccidiodes-specific antigen (CSA) and the proline-rich cell wall protein Ag2/PRA, either as a mixture of two separately expressed proteins or as a single chimeric expression product was shown to protect mice from a lethal intranasal infection with C. posadasii (Shubitz et al., 2006). The protection observed with each vaccination strategy was associated with robust IFN-┛ responses in protected mice, again showing the importance of Th1-type cytokines during protective host responses. Further, these studies highlighted the utility of a multivalent vaccination strategy that potentially evokes protective responses towards a broader set of T-cell epitopes.\n\nThe importance of CD4+ T cells and the generation of Th1-type responses towards eliciting protection against pulmonary fungal pathogens are also observed in vaccination models using a live C. neoformans strain engineered to express IFN-┛ (Wormley et al., 2007) (Wozniak et al., 2009) (Young et al., 2009), a live attenuated strain of B. dermatitidis (Wuthrich et al., 2000), and recombinant A. fumigatus protein Asp f3 (Diaz-Arevalo et al., 2011). Immunization with recombinant Asp f3 of A. fumigatus protected cortisone acetate immune suppressed mice from an experimental pulmonary infection with A. fumigatus conidia (Diaz-Arevalo et al., 2011). The protection was dependent on CD4+ T cells as their depletion reduced the survival of vaccinated mice and adoptive transfer of Aspf3 primed CD4+ T cells into non-vaccinated mice enhanced their survival against experimentally induced pulmonary aspergillosis. Generation of sterilizing immunity in mice following pulmonary immunization with a C. neoformans strain engineered to express murine IFN-┛, designated H99┛, was shown to require the induction of Th1-type cell-mediated immune responses (Wozniak et al., 2009). Interestingly, B-cell deficient mice immunized with H99┛ were protected from a subsequent lethal pulmonary challenge with WT C. neoformans (Wozniak et al., 2009; Young et al., 2009; Wozniak et al., 2011b). Also, vaccination of mice with an attenuated strain of B. dermatitidis containing a targeted deletion in the BAD1 locus resulted in prolonged survival that was chiefly mediated by IFN-┛ and TNF-┙ production by CD4+ T cells (Wuthrich et al., 2000; Wuthrich et al., 2002). Although these studies show that Th1-type CD4+ T cell responses are required for optimal host responses against these pulmonary pathogens, studies in H. capsulatum, B. dermititidis, and C. neoformans highlight the inherent plasticity of the host response against pulmonary fungal pathogens. That is that some elements of the immune response can compensate for the loss of other components.\n\nVaccine-induced immunity against B. dermatitidis was shown be mediated by CD4+ ┙/┚ T cell production of TNF-┙ and IFN-┛ (Wuthrich et al., 2002). Moreover, the initiation, but not maintenance, of protective memory responses to B dermatitidis required IL-12 production (Wuthrich et al., 2005). However, vaccine-induced immunity could be elicited and expressed in IFN-┛ and TNF-┙ deficient mice. The reciprocal cytokine or the presence of GM-CSF was shown to compensate for the loss of IFN-┛ and TNF-┙ showing some plasticity in the vaccine-induced host response to Blastomyces (Wuthrich et al., 2002). Furthermore, a role for Th17 cells in vaccine-induced protection against multiple pulmonary fungal pathogens has been shown (Wuthrich et al., 2011). Specifically, protection afforded by vaccination against C. posadassi, H. capsulatum, and B. dermatitidis was observed to be dependent on IL-17. In fact, IL-17 was shown to be indispensable since vaccinated IL-17A or IL-17RA deficient mice showed impaired anti-fungal resistance despite having normal Th1-type cytokine expression. In contrast, IL-17A was shown to contribute to but ultimately be dispensable for protection against experimental pulmonary cryptococcosis in C. neoformans strain H99┛ vaccinated mice (Hardison et al., 2010b; Wozniak et al., 2011a). Still, it appears imperative that vaccines strategies to prevent pulmonary mycoses be evaluated for their capacity to induce Th1 and Th17-type cytokine responses.\n\nThe induction of T cell-mediated immune responses is critical for optimal protection against pulmonary fungal pathogens (Cutler et al., 2007). Consequently, it may seem counterintuitive to suggest that vaccines designed to prevent fungal infections in patients with T cell deficiencies is possible. Nonetheless, vaccination studies using experimental models of H. capsulatum (Deepe and Gibbons, 2002), P. brasiliensis (de Bastos Ascenco Soares et al., 2008), H. capsulatum (Wuthrich et al., 2003), B. dermatitidis (Wuthrich et al., 2002; Wuthrich et al., 2003), C. immitis (Fierer et al., 2006), and C. neoformans (Wozniak et al., 2011b) have indicated that vaccine-induced protective immune responses can be elicited in immune deficient hosts. Cumulatively, the studies show that the presence of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells is essential for the induction (the period following vaccination) and expression (immune response following challenge) phases of the protective immune response. Protection is not induced in mice that are T cell deficient or depleted of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations. Further, protection is lost in vaccinated mice following deletion of both T cell subsets. Interestingly, 80% of mice vaccinated with C. neoformans strain H99┛ and subsequently depleted of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were protected from a lethal pulmonary challenge with WT C. neoformans (Wozniak et al., 2011b). These studies highlight dynamic compensatory mechanisms that mediate vaccine-induced protection during both the induction and expression phases of the anti-fungal immune response. Altogether, the results demonstrating the plasticity of the vaccine-induced immune response to pulmonary fungal pathogens are particularly exciting as they highlight the potential for inducing protection in immune competent and immune compromised hosts.\n\n4.6 Antibody-mediated immunity and therapeutics\n\nThe contribution of antibody mediated immunity (AMI) towards protecting individuals against pulmonary fungal infections remains uncertain. Individuals with humoral deficiencies such as autosomal hyper-IgM syndrome and IgA deficiency do not exhibit an increased susceptibility to fungal infections (reviewed in Antachopoulos, 2007, 2010). In contrast, patients with X-linked hyper IgM syndrome and common-variable immunodeficiency which are often accompanied by defects in T CMI have a higher risk of developing pulmonary and invasive fungal infections like cryptococcosis and histoplasmosis. The efficacious role for antibodies during the host immune responses against fungi is like that observed against bacterial and viral pathogens. Antibodies produced in response to fungal infection serve as opsonins to promote phagocytosis, participate in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, augment Th1-type polarization, help to eliminate immunosuppressive polysaccharide antigen from serum and tissues, inhibit biofilm formation, have direct antifungal activity, and modulate the immune response to prevent host damage (reviewed in Alvarez and Casadevall, 2007; reviewed in Zaragoza and Casadevall, 2004).\n\nMost studies showing the efficacy of AMI against pulmonary fungal pathogens has involved experimental models of PcP and cryptocococcosis. The polysaccharide capsule of Cryptococcus, its main virulence determinant, is predominantly comprised of the polysaccharides glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) and galactoxylomannan (GalXM) and to a much lesser extent, <1%, mannoproteins (MP) (reviewed in Zaragoza et al., 2009). Conjugate vaccines consisting of GXM combined to either tetanus toxoid (TT) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa exoprotein A (rEPA) induce high antibody titers (Devi et al., 1991; Casadevall et al., 1992), enhanced antifungal activity of murine and human phagocytes (Mukherjee et al., 1995c; Zhong and Pirofski, 1996, 1998) and conferred some protection against cryptococcosis in mice (Devi, 1996; Fleuridor et al., 1998; Nussbaum et al., 1999). Unfortunately, the profound suppressive effects on immune responses induced by cryptococcal polysaccharides and the highly variable immune responses observed in response to the intact GXM portion of the conjugate vaccine renders it an unlikely choice for future vaccine development (reviewed in Zaragoza et al., 2009; reviewed in Pirofski, 2001). A strategy using small peptide mimotopes (peptides which are able to induce antibodies that are capable of binding to the native antigen when administered as an immunogen) that mimic defined GXM epitopes was attempted to elicit protective antibody responses where using total GXM was unsuccessful. Zhang et al. described a peptide mimetic (P13) of GXM that was recognized by human anti-GXM antibodies (Zhang et al., 1997) and showed that vaccination with P13-protein conjugates in mice resulted in prolonged survival after a lethal C. neoformans challenge compared to controls (Fleuridor et al., 2001) or following establishment of a chronic infection (Datta et al., 2008).\n\nCasadevall et al. developed a murine monoclonal antibody (MAb), 18B7, to C. neoformans polysaccharide that underwent phase I clinical studies in HIV+ patients with cryptococcal antigenemia (Casadevall et al., 1998). A modest reduction in serum cryptococcal antigen titers was observed in patients receiving singular doses of 1 and 2 mg/kg up to 10 weeks post-treatment before returning to baseline (Casadevall et al., 1998). To date, no follow-up clinical studies have been published. A new approach using MAb 18B7 currently being investigated in mice involves conjugation of the MAb to the therapeutic radioisotopes 188Rhenium or 213Bismuth (Dadachova et al., 2003; Bryan et al., 2010). Studies have shown that administration of radiolabeled MAb 18B7 to lethally infected mice results in prolonged survival, reduced organ fungal burden, and was a more effective therapy compared to mice treated with amphotericin B. Radioimmunotherapy can be applied using MAb derived against multiple pulmonary fungal pathogens and thus may evolve into an attractive option for the treatment of other pulmonary mycoses. Lastly, while most studies have examined passive administration with antibodies targeting C. neoformans polysaccharide, other cryptococcal targets for passive antibody therapy under experimental investigation include melanin (Rosas et al., 2001), ┚-glucan (Rachini et al., 2007), heat shock protein (HSP) 90 (Nooney et al., 2005) and glucosylceramide (Rodrigues et al., 2007).\n\nMice deficient in B cells, either due to a targeted disruption of the IgM constant region (µMT mice) or using depletion antibodies, are more susceptible to PcP infection (Harmsen and Stankiewicz, 1991; Marcotte et al., 1996) (Lund et al., 2003; Lund et al., 2006). These studies showed that B cells were able to provide protection against PcP not only by producing Ab but also by amplifying the CD4+ T cell-mediated immune response. Passive administration of an IgM mAb shown to be directed against a surface antigen present on rat-, rabbit-, ferret- , and human-derived P. carinii induced partial protection against PcP in animal models (Gigliotti and Hughes, 1988). Subsequent studies showed that the passive administration of mAbs recognizing kexin-like molecule (KEX1) via the intranasal route prior to experimentally induced PcP resulted in a significant reduction in pulmonary fungal burden (~99%) (Gigliotti et al., 2002).\n\nContrasting studies have shown that B cell deficient µMT mice have lower pulmonary fungal burden following intranasal infection with A. fumigatus (Montagnoli et al., 2003) or B. dermatitidis (Wuthrich et al., 2000) and are not more susceptible to experimental pulmonary histoplasmosis infection (Allendorfer et al., 1999) compared to WT controls. Also, passive transfer of polyclonal serum or MAbs obtained from A. fumigatus, B. dermatitidis, or C. immttis vaccinated mice did not enhance protection against a subsequent intranasal challenge with these pathogens (Kong et al., 1965; Beaman et al., 1977; Frosco et al., 1994; Wuthrich et al., 2000; Beaman et al., 1979). The role of antibodies in the host defense against fungal infection remains controversial because of its complexity. The current consensus is that antifungal antibodies can mediate protective, nonprotective, or disease-enhancing effects on host defenses during infection (Mukherjee et al., 1995a; Mukherjee et al., 1995b; Yuan et al., 1998a). Thus, resistance to disease may depend upon the proportion of protective antifungal antibodies produced during infection. In support of this concept, non-protective and protective MAbs to C. neoformans has been described (Mukherjee et al., 1995a; Maitta et al., 2004). Also, Nosanchuk et al. demonstrated that mice passively administered MAbs targeting a histone H2B-like protein on the surface of H. capsulatum before infection experienced a reduction in fungal burden and prolonged survival (Nosanchuk et al., 2003). These studies were somewhat surprising in light of previous studies showing no increased susceptibility to experimental histoplasmosis infection in B cell deficient mice (Allendorfer et al., 1999). Studies in C. neoformans has shown that the efficacy of MAbs appears to be dependent on several variables including host genetics (Rivera and Casadevall, 2005), Ab isotype (Yuan et al., 1995; Yuan et al., 1998b), T cell function (Yuan et al., 1997), and the presence of Th1- and Th2-related cytokines (Beenhouwer et al., 2001). AMI during the protective response to pulmonary fungal pathogens is broad and divergent, but it is clear that specific antibodies are efficacious for the host in the resolution of infection.\n\nStudies also support the potential of using antibodies that target antigens common among multiple fungi to mediate cross-protection. Passive immunization using anti ┚-glucan MAbs or vaccination with ┚-glucan (laminarin) conjugated with the genetically-inactivated diphtheria toxin CRM197 (Lam-CRM vaccine) has been shown to confer protection against C. neoformans, C. albicans and A. fumigatus (Torosantucci et al., 2005; Rachini et al., 2007). Since ┚-glucans are found in the cell wall of fungi, the efficacy of anti-┚-glucan antibodies can be very broad. Cenci et al. used a killer anti-idiotype MAb reacting to a yeast killer toxin to protect mice from a lethal A. fumigatus challenge during experimental bone marrow transplantation (Cenci and Romani and 2375). Killer toxin is also expressed by multiple fungal species. Mycograb (NeuTec Pharman plc.), a recombinant antibody targeting an epitope within the HSP90 of Candida albicans that is conserved with the corresponding protein in C. neoformans, has been shown to act in adjunct with amphotericin B against multiple Candida species and C. neoformans. Altogether, these studies highlight the possibility that antibodies targeting \"universal' antigens common to multiple fungal species such as ┚-glucans, killer toxins, or Hsps may extend protection to multiple disparate fungal pathogens. Casadevall and Pirofski has published an elegant commentary on the emergence of cross-protective targets for fungi (Casadevall and Pirofski, 2007).\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nThe principal route of entry for several of the primary and opportunistic fungal pathogens is via inhalation of infectious propagules into the lungs. Consequently, exposure to these fungi is unavoidable. Nevertheless, most encounters are asymptomatic due to the quick resolution of the fungi by resident effector cells within the lung. On those occasions that the fungal insult cannot be quickly eradicated, T cells, predominantly CD4+ T cells, preside over orchestrating the adaptive responses and provide help for antibody production. T cell responses are also influenced by cytokine production by innate effector cells. Nonetheless, T cells mediate various cellular responses at the sites of infection and are ultimately responsible for either resolution or pathological reactions associated with these infections. Furthermore, T cells are important players in homeostasis and protecting integrity of natural barriers. Recent advances in experimental animal models support the premise that antifungal vaccines may be effective in immune compromised hosts. The efficacy of anti-fungal vaccines in immune compromised populations is undoubtedly due to the inherent plasticity of host immunity. Altogether, it is clear that immune responses to pulmonary fungal infections are as diverse as the fungi themselves but that significant ground has been made towards its understanding.\n\n6.

Caused by bacteria,viruses or fungi, respiratory infections require distinct knowledge of recent advances in pathogenesis. Progressin the understanding of immunopathogenesis of Acinetobacter baumannii infection will explain how an atypicalorganism establishes infection. The chapter regarding pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial infections inthe State of Para depicts a unique study in an endemic region for tuberculosis in North of Brazil. The diagnosisand treatment of latent tuberculosis is a formidable challenge. Thus, new developments in diagnosis andtreatment of latent tuberculosis are included in this book. Challenging in their diagnosis, nontuberculousmycobacterial pulmonary diseases require special education for management. The problems of respiratoryinfections in the immunocompromised host are increasing in numbers and in resilience to treatment.Therefore, the chapter describing the host immune responses against pulmonary fungal pathogens comes asa necessary section in this book. The insight brought forth from this book can be valuable for both cliniciansand scientists.\n\nHow to reference\n\nIn order to correctly reference this scholarly work, feel free to copy and paste the following:\n\nKaren L.

A randomised controlled trial examined the effects of withholding cows' milk protein during the first three months of life and replacing cows' milk with soya milk. The children were followed up to the age of 7 years. Withholding cows' milk did not reduce the incidence of allergy or wheezing. Children who had ever been breast fed had a lower incidence ofwheeze than those who had not (59% and 74% respectively). The effect persisted to age 7 years in the non-atopics only, the risk ofwheeze being halved in the breast fed children after allowing for employment status, sex, passive smoking, and overcrowding. Allergic disease was not associated with exposure to tobacco smoke, house dust mite antigen, or cats. Breast feeding may confer long term protection against respiratory infection.\n</p><p>(Arch Dis Child 1993; 68: 724-728)\n</p><p>Centre for Applied Public Health Medicine, Temple of Peace and\n</p><p>Health, Cathays Park,\n</p><p>Cardiff, South\n</p><p>Glamorgan CF1 3NW\n</p><p>Michael L Burr\n</p><p>MRC Epidemiology Unit,\n</p><p>Llandough Hospital,\n</p><p>Penarth, South Glamorgan Elizabeth S Limb Linda Amarah Beverley A Eldridge\n</p><p>Jane CM Layzell\n</p><p>Prince Charles Hospital,\n</p><p>Merthyr Tydfil, Mid\n</p><p>Wheezing is a common symptom in childhood. Its causes include infection, allergy, and exposure to atmospheric irritants such as tobacco smoke. In 1982 a study was set up to investigate prospectively the onset ofwheezing in a cohort of children from birth.'2 The children were selected so as to have a high risk of wheezing illness in two respects: they lived in an area (two valleys in South Wales) known to have a high prevalence of chest disease,3 and they all had a parent or sibling with a history of atopic disease. One objective of the study was to examine the possibility4 that withholding cows' milk protein for young infants at high risk of allergy reduces their incidence of asthma. To this end, a randomised controlled trial was conducted in which half the babies were given soya milk instead of cows' milk preparations; no evidence of benefit emerged during the first year of life.'\n</p><h4><p>A further objective of the study </p></h4><p>was to observe year have already been published.' 25 The children have now been followed up to the age of 7 years, and this paper presents the findings at that time.\n</p><p>Methods\n</p><p>Women attending antenatal clinics were asked whether they, their husbands, or their children had ever had asthma, eczema, or hay fever and those who replied affirmatively were invited to take part in this study. The women were randomly allocated to an intervention group, which was supplied with soya milk as an alternative to cows' milk formulation when the baby was born, and a control group, which was not. Mothers in the intervention group were asked to avoid giving the baby any food containing cows' milk protein for four months, and advised to restrict their daily milk intake to half a pint (284 ml) during the pregnancy and while they were breast feeding. Information was collected about the feeding of the infants (including the duration of breast feeding) and other potentially relevant factors.' 2 Samples of dust were taken from the infants' beds, their mothers' beds, and the carpets on which they were most often placed, and examined for mite antigen by means of an\n</p><p>inhibitory radioimmunoassay5; the sample with the highest antigen concentration for each child was taken to represent mite exposure.

'Allergic rhinitis (diagnosis)' similarly relates to the previous 12 months. At the age of 7, a history of asthma and the doctor's diagnosis of it occurred more frequently in boys than in girls, and a wheeze was reported more frequently in the annual questionnaires among the boys than among the girls. Eczema was diagnosed more frequently among\n</p><p>the girls at 7 years. There was a non-significant tendency for allergic rhinitis to occur more among the boys than among the girls. Table 2 shows the same data according to the original randomisation groups. The numbers are slightly less than those in table 1 because a few children were excluded from the randomised trial but not from the observational data.' No significant differences occurred between the two groups. Figure 1 shows the percentage of children who were reported to have wheezed each year. The children are classified into those who were and were not atopic at the age of 7, where atopy is defined as the occurrence of any positive skin test weal at least 3 mm greater in diameter than the control weal. The proportion of children who wheezed tended to decline among those who were non-atopic and to increase among those who were atopic. In table 3 the children are classified into those who had ever been breast fed (for however short a time) and those who had not.

The risk of wheezing was significantly reduced by breast feeding for the first two years of life; thereafter the risk remained lower in the breast fed but never quite achieved statistical significance. The effect of breast feeding was then examined separately in the atopic and non-atopic children (defined as above). Figure 3 shows that after the second year of life the favourable implications of breast feeding persisted among those who were non-atopic but not among those who were atopic. Duration of breast feeding was significantly related to wheeze during the seventh year in those who were non-atopic, the odds ratio being 0 90 for each week of breast feeding (95% confidence interval 0 83 to 0 97): that is, for each additional week, the risk of wheezing was reduced by a factor of 0-9. The social class of the children was determined in terms of the current occupation of the main wage earner at 7 years.

This difference was found only among the non-atopic children, for whom the incidence of wheezing among the employed and unemployed groups was 17% and 40% respectively (p&lt;0-001). As previously reported,2 there was a strong association at 1 year of age between wheezing and the presence of a smoker (particularly the mother) in the house, and this association persisted when several other factors were allowed for by means of logistic regression. At the age of 7 years the presence of a smoker in the house (as reported then) was significantly associated with wheeze in the past year among those who were non-atopic only, the incidence of wheezing being 15% where nobody smoked and 28% where someone smoked (p&lt;0-0 1). Among the atopic children there were no associations between wheeze and smoking at any time (including smoking in pregnancy), and smoking was unrelated to asthma, eczema, and allergic rhinitis. Table 4 examines the independent effects of each of five variables on wheeze among non-atopic children when the other four variables were allowed for, using logistic regression. Breast feeding and employment status retained their effects on risk of wheezing during the seventh year of life. This criterion was chosen as the other information was recorded at age 7 and might be expected to show the clearest associations with recent history. There was some association between smoking in the house and recent wheezing, but the relationship was not statistically significant after the other factors were allowed for. Other data may be briefly summarised. Wheezing was not associated with cat ownership, mode of heating, the presence of damp patches or mould inside the house, the number of people living in the house, or the degree of overcrowding (number of people divided by number of rooms). When the initial exposure to mite antigen was classified as low, medium, and high the proportions of children with positive mite skin tests at age 7 were 20%, 20%, and 22% children with low,\n</p><p>0-2\nage of the initial value was lower for the atopic wheezers than for the non-atopic wheezers and the non-wheezers (91-4%, 98-2%, and 98-g% respectively: p&lt;0-001 atopic wheezers v non-wheezers).\n</p><p>Discussion\n</p><p>This study concerns children living in an area that has a high prevalence of chest disease.3 They were further selected so as to have an above average risk of allergy in that they all had a first degree relative with a history of atopic disease. This selective process is likely to facilitate the recognition of factors that predict respiratory symptoms, although it does not necessarily follow that they would operate in the same way in a different group of children. The follow up rate was, high (91% of the original cohort), so that there was little danger of bias arising from differential follow up. The annual questionnaires ensured that a transient period of wheezing was recorded while it was still remembered, and dated fairly accurately. Overall, 68% of the children wheezed at some time; by comparison, 63% of a similarly defined group of children in another area wheezed by the age of 11 years.8 The lower mean PEFR in wheezers compared with non-wheezers shows that a parental report of wheezing was accompanied by some objective evidence of impaired function. The excess frequency ofwheezing and asthma among the boys, and of eczema among the girls, accords with findings from other surveys.2\"' The withholding of cows' milk protein did not produce any decrease in the frequency of wheeze, asthma, eczema, or allergic rhinitis. Compliance was reasonably good, though not perfect: cows' milk protein was taken at least once in the first four weeks by 11% of babies in the intervention group and by 91% of the controls, and in the first three months by 26% and 96% respectively.1 Objective evidence of differential exposure to cows' milk protein was provided by milk specific serum IgG4 antibodies, which were detected in 37% of the intervention group and 70% ofthe control group at 3 months.5 The difference between the groups in this regard should have been sufficient to reveal an important protective effect of cows' milk avoidance if it existed, although admittedly a minor effect might have been undetected. These results con-ffict with the findings of Johnstone and Dutton, who reported a reduction in the 10 year incidence of asthma and perennial allergic rhinitis in children given soya milk in infancy rather than a cows' milk preparation.4 There was, however, ment ofatopy, wheezing, or a positive skin test at the age of 7 years. The lack of association between wheezing and current cat ownership is perhaps not surprising as families containing an allergic child tend not to keep a cat.'7 Both mite and cat antigen seem to be sufficiently widespread to sensitise susceptible children irrespective ofthe degree ofmite infestation or whether a cat lives in the same house.'8\n</p><p>Respiratory disease in childhood can be caused by infection or allergy. A prospective study of 67 babies born to atopic families found that the onset ofwheeze after the age of 2 years-but not before - was associated with persistent wheeze, atopy, and bronchial hyper-reactivity at the age of 11 years,8 suggesting that infection predominates in wheezing illness before the age of 2 years and allergy thereafter. Similar conclusions emerged in the present study, in that the annual incidence of wheezing tended to decline after the age of 2 years in those who were non-atopic and increase marginally in those who were atopic. The atopic wheezers tended to respond to exercise by a fall in PEFR greater than that ofthe non-atopic wheezers and the non-wheezers, implying that exercise induced asthma was largely confined to the atopic group of wheezers. Employment status had a major effect on non-atopic wheeze; the important factor was whether the parents were employed or not, rather than their social class. The 'unemployed' group contained a high proportion of one parent families, and presumably the child's susceptibility to wheeze was a reflection of fundamental social factors. It is noteworthy that socioeconomic status is a consistent feature of chronic respiratory disease, which seems to have a predilection for the less privileged groups quite apart from their smoking habits. 19\n</p><p>Passive smoking is a recognised cause of respiratory symptoms in early childhood.20 In this study it was a major independent risk factor for wheeze during the child's first year of life; by the age of 7 years the effect was no longer statistically significant when allowance was made for certain other variables, although it was still quite large. The relationship between wheeze and passive smoking was confined to the non-atopic children - that is, maternal and other passive smoking did not appear to increase the risk of atopy nor of symptoms in the atopics, as has been suggested.2 22\n</p><p>During the first year of life, wheezing occurred twice as frequently in those who were never breast fed as in those who had received any breast milk, and this relationship could not be accounted for by other factors such as social\nwheezing due to infection rather than in wheezing due to allergy. The question arises as to whether this relationship is causal or whether it is attributable to confounding variables. Obviously those mothers who choose to breast feed their babies differ from those who do not, and these differences may be reflected in the risk of infection. The analysis allowed for the confounding effects ofemployment status, smoking habit, and overcrowding, each of which might be associated with both feeding practice and risk of infection. It may be that other factors are involved, such as standards of hygiene, which are difficult to define but have a major effect on disease transmission. But the effect would have to be very large, and the association with breast feeding very close, in order to explain the observed relationship. Is there any plausible mechanism by which breast feeding could confer protection against respiratory infections up to the age of 7 years, apparently with undiminished effect? A group of Indian breast fed babies had a lower incidence of respiratory and other infections than bottle fed babies matched for socioeconomic status, parental education and occupation, and family size.27 In two British case-control studies infants with respiratory syncytial virus infection were less likely to have been breast fed than unaffected infants. The effect was not confined to current breast feeding, and the differences persisted when allowance was made for social class30 or a variety of confounding factors including smoking.3' One of these studies showed that respiratory syncytial virus neutralising activity was detectable in every one of 21 samples of human colostrum, 18 of which also contained specific IgA and IgG.30 A study in Brazil suggested that breast feeding reduces infant mortality from respiratory infection.32 A randomised controlled trial of expressed breast milk in 261 low birthweight infants showed highly significant protection against a variety of infections.33 Several follow up studies have shown that infants admitted to hospital with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis have an increased incidence of wheeze over the next few years,34 35 so protection against the initial infection could confer longer term benefits. It is therefore not wholly implausible to postulate that breast feeding in infancy protects children against respiratory infections for several years.\n</p><p>This work was conducted with the aid of a grant from the Welsh Scheme for the Development of Health and Social Research. 6 Burr ML, St Leger AS, Bevan C, Merrett TG.

A randomised controlled trial examined the effects of withholding cows' milk protein during the first three months of life and replacing cows' milk with soya milk. The children were followed up to the age of 7 years. Withholding cows' milk did not reduce the incidence of allergy or wheezing. Children who had ever been breast fed had a lower incidence ofwheeze than those who had not (59% and 74% respectively). The effect persisted to age 7 years in the non-atopics only, the risk ofwheeze being halved in the breast fed children after allowing for employment status, sex, passive smoking, and overcrowding. Allergic disease was not associated with exposure to tobacco smoke, house dust mite antigen, or cats. Breast feeding may confer long term protection against respiratory infection.\n\n(Arch Dis Child 1993; 68: 724-728)\n\nCentre for Applied Public Health Medicine, Temple of Peace and\n\nHealth, Cathays Park,\n\nCardiff, South\n\nGlamorgan CF1 3NW\n\nMichael L Burr\n\nMRC Epidemiology Unit,\n\nLlandough Hospital,\n\nPenarth, South Glamorgan Elizabeth S Limb Linda Amarah Beverley A Eldridge\n\nJane CM Layzell\n\nPrince Charles Hospital,\n\nMerthyr Tydfil, Mid\n\nWheezing is a common symptom in childhood. Its causes include infection, allergy, and exposure to atmospheric irritants such as tobacco smoke. In 1982 a study was set up to investigate prospectively the onset ofwheezing in a cohort of children from birth.'2 The children were selected so as to have a high risk of wheezing illness in two respects: they lived in an area (two valleys in South Wales) known to have a high prevalence of chest disease,3 and they all had a parent or sibling with a history of atopic disease. One objective of the study was to examine the possibility4 that withholding cows' milk protein for young infants at high risk of allergy reduces their incidence of asthma. To this end, a randomised controlled trial was conducted in which half the babies were given soya milk instead of cows' milk preparations; no evidence of benefit emerged during the first year of life.'\n\nA further objective of the study\n\nwas to observe year have already been published.' 25 The children have now been followed up to the age of 7 years, and this paper presents the findings at that time.\n\nMethods\n\nWomen attending antenatal clinics were asked whether they, their husbands, or their children had ever had asthma, eczema, or hay fever and those who replied affirmatively were invited to take part in this study. The women were randomly allocated to an intervention group, which was supplied with soya milk as an alternative to cows' milk formulation when the baby was born, and a control group, which was not. Mothers in the intervention group were asked to avoid giving the baby any food containing cows' milk protein for four months, and advised to restrict their daily milk intake to half a pint (284 ml) during the pregnancy and while they were breast feeding. Information was collected about the feeding of the infants (including the duration of breast feeding) and other potentially relevant factors.' 2 Samples of dust were taken from the infants' beds, their mothers' beds, and the carpets on which they were most often placed, and examined for mite antigen by means of an\n\ninhibitory radioimmunoassay5; the sample with the highest antigen concentration for each child was taken to represent mite exposure. The infants were examined three times during their first year of life by a doctor who was unaware of how the children had been fed. A sample of blood was taken when they were three months old and assayed for milk specific IgG4 anti-\n\nbodies.5\n\nAt the time of their second to their sixth birthdays the children were sent birthday cards; these cards incorporated a few questions (including an inquiry about wheeze coming from the chest during the past year), which the mothers were asked to answer and return.

The mean of the highest three readings was taken as the true value on each occasion. No attempt was made to standardise speed of running, temperature, or humidity, the exercise being always conducted indoors at ordinary room temperature. Further samples of dust were obtained from the children's mattresses and assayed for Der p I by an enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) method, giving a between assay coefficient of variation of 14-16% at the extreme ends of the standard calibration curve.

'Eczema (diagnosis)' includes current eczema and a history of eczema within the past year, according to the paediatrician's opinion. 'Allergic rhinitis (diagnosis)' similarly relates to the previous 12 months. At the age of 7, a history of asthma and the doctor's diagnosis of it occurred more frequently in boys than in girls, and a wheeze was reported more frequently in the annual questionnaires among the boys than among the girls. Eczema was diagnosed more frequently among\n\nthe girls at 7 years. There was a non-significant tendency for allergic rhinitis to occur more among the boys than among the girls.

Figure 3 shows that after the second year of life the favourable implications of breast feeding persisted among those who were non-atopic but not among those who were atopic. Duration of breast feeding was significantly related to wheeze during the seventh year in those who were non-atopic, the odds ratio being 0 90 for each week of breast feeding (95% confidence interval 0 83 to 0 97): that is, for each additional week, the risk of wheezing was reduced by a factor of 0-9. The social class of the children was determined in terms of the current occupation of the main wage earner at 7 years. Wheeze during the\n\n4'\n\n2\n\n0 Co4_\n\nco 0\n\nNon-atopics\n\n;o ' ± ± T T\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\n0*5\n\n02\n\n0\n\nCUCo '0 *0\n\nseventh year was reported in 27% of those in social classes I-III non-manual, 24% in those in classes III manual-V, and 42% in those whose parents stated they were unemployed, the difference between employed and unemployed being highly significant (p<0-01). This difference was found only among the non-atopic children, for whom the incidence of wheezing among the employed and unemployed groups was 17% and 40% respectively (p<0-001). As previously reported,2 there was a strong association at 1 year of age between wheezing and the presence of a smoker (particularly the mother) in the house, and this association persisted when several other factors were allowed for by means of logistic regression. At the age of 7 years the presence of a smoker in the house (as reported then) was significantly associated with wheeze in the past year among those who were non-atopic only, the incidence of wheezing being 15% where nobody smoked and 28% where someone smoked (p<0-0 1). Among the atopic children there were no associations between wheeze and smoking at any time (including smoking in pregnancy), and smoking was unrelated to asthma, eczema, and allergic rhinitis. Table 4 examines the independent effects of each of five variables on wheeze among non-atopic children when the other four variables were allowed for, using logistic regression. Breast feeding and employment status retained their effects on risk of wheezing during the seventh year of life. This criterion was chosen as the other information was recorded at age 7 and might be expected to show the clearest associations with recent history. There was some association between smoking in the house and recent wheezing, but the relationship was not statistically significant after the other factors were allowed for. Other data may be briefly summarised. Wheezing was not associated with cat ownership, mode of heating, the presence of damp patches or mould inside the house, the number of people living in the house, or the degree of overcrowding (number of people divided by number of rooms). When the initial exposure to mite antigen was classified as low, medium, and high the proportions of children with positive mite skin tests at age 7 were 20%, 20%, and 22% children with low,\n\n0-2 age of the initial value was lower for the atopic wheezers than for the non-atopic wheezers and the non-wheezers (91-4%, 98-2%, and 98-g% respectively: p<0-001 atopic wheezers v non-wheezers).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study concerns children living in an area that has a high prevalence of chest disease.3 They were further selected so as to have an above average risk of allergy in that they all had a first degree relative with a history of atopic disease. This selective process is likely to facilitate the recognition of factors that predict respiratory symptoms, although it does not necessarily follow that they would operate in the same way in a different group of children. The follow up rate was, high (91% of the original cohort), so that there was little danger of bias arising from differential follow up. The annual questionnaires ensured that a transient period of wheezing was recorded while it was still remembered, and dated fairly accurately. Overall, 68% of the children wheezed at some time; by comparison, 63% of a similarly defined group of children in another area wheezed by the age of 11 years.8 The lower mean PEFR in wheezers compared with non-wheezers shows that a parental report of wheezing was accompanied by some objective evidence of impaired function. The excess frequency ofwheezing and asthma among the boys, and of eczema among the girls, accords with findings from other surveys.2\"' The withholding of cows' milk protein did not produce any decrease in the frequency of wheeze, asthma, eczema, or allergic rhinitis. Compliance was reasonably good, though not perfect: cows' milk protein was taken at least once in the first four weeks by 11% of babies in the intervention group and by 91% of the controls, and in the first three months by 26% and 96% respectively.1 Objective evidence of differential exposure to cows' milk protein was provided by milk specific serum IgG4 antibodies, which were detected in 37% of the intervention group and 70% ofthe control group at 3 months.5 The difference between the groups in this regard should have been sufficient to reveal an important protective effect of cows' milk avoidance if it existed, although admittedly a minor effect might have been undetected. These results con-ffict with the findings of Johnstone and Dutton, who reported a reduction in the 10 year incidence of asthma and perennial allergic rhinitis in children given soya milk in infancy rather than a cows' milk preparation.4 There was, however, ment ofatopy, wheezing, or a positive skin test at the age of 7 years. The lack of association between wheezing and current cat ownership is perhaps not surprising as families containing an allergic child tend not to keep a cat.'7 Both mite and cat antigen seem to be sufficiently widespread to sensitise susceptible children irrespective ofthe degree ofmite infestation or whether a cat lives in the same house.'8\n\nRespiratory disease in childhood can be caused by infection or allergy. A prospective study of 67 babies born to atopic families found that the onset ofwheeze after the age of 2 years-but not before - was associated with persistent wheeze, atopy, and bronchial hyper-reactivity at the age of 11 years,8 suggesting that infection predominates in wheezing illness before the age of 2 years and allergy thereafter. Similar conclusions emerged in the present study, in that the annual incidence of wheezing tended to decline after the age of 2 years in those who were non-atopic and increase marginally in those who were atopic. The atopic wheezers tended to respond to exercise by a fall in PEFR greater than that ofthe non-atopic wheezers and the non-wheezers, implying that exercise induced asthma was largely confined to the atopic group of wheezers. Employment status had a major effect on non-atopic wheeze; the important factor was whether the parents were employed or not, rather than their social class. The 'unemployed' group contained a high proportion of one parent families, and presumably the child's susceptibility to wheeze was a reflection of fundamental social factors. It is noteworthy that socioeconomic status is a consistent feature of chronic respiratory disease, which seems to have a predilection for the less privileged groups quite apart from their smoking habits. 19\n\nPassive smoking is a recognised cause of respiratory symptoms in early childhood.20 In this study it was a major independent risk factor for wheeze during the child's first year of life; by the age of 7 years the effect was no longer statistically significant when allowance was made for certain other variables, although it was still quite large. The relationship between wheeze and passive smoking was confined to the non-atopic children - that is, maternal and other passive smoking did not appear to increase the risk of atopy nor of symptoms in the atopics, as has been suggested.2 22\n\nDuring the first year of life, wheezing occurred twice as frequently in those who were never breast fed as in those who had received any breast milk, and this relationship could not be accounted for by other factors such as social wheezing due to infection rather than in wheezing due to allergy. The question arises as to whether this relationship is causal or whether it is attributable to confounding variables. Obviously those mothers who choose to breast feed their babies differ from those who do not, and these differences may be reflected in the risk of infection. The analysis allowed for the confounding effects ofemployment status, smoking habit, and overcrowding, each of which might be associated with both feeding practice and risk of infection. It may be that other factors are involved, such as standards of hygiene, which are difficult to define but have a major effect on disease transmission. But the effect would have to be very large, and the association with breast feeding very close, in order to explain the observed relationship. Is there any plausible mechanism by which breast feeding could confer protection against respiratory infections up to the age of 7 years, apparently with undiminished effect? A group of Indian breast fed babies had a lower incidence of respiratory and other infections than bottle fed babies matched for socioeconomic status, parental education and occupation, and family size.27 In two British case-control studies infants with respiratory syncytial virus infection were less likely to have been breast fed than unaffected infants. The effect was not confined to current breast feeding, and the differences persisted when allowance was made for social class30 or a variety of confounding factors including smoking.3' One of these studies showed that respiratory syncytial virus neutralising activity was detectable in every one of 21 samples of human colostrum, 18 of which also contained specific IgA and IgG.30 A study in Brazil suggested that breast feeding reduces infant mortality from respiratory infection.32 A randomised controlled trial of expressed breast milk in 261 low birthweight infants showed highly significant protection against a variety of infections.33 Several follow up studies have shown that infants admitted to hospital with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis have an increased incidence of wheeze over the next few years,34 35 so protection against the initial infection could confer longer term benefits. It is therefore not wholly implausible to postulate that breast feeding in infancy protects children against respiratory infections for several years.\n\nThis work was conducted with the aid of a grant from the Welsh Scheme for the Development of Health and Social Research. 6 Burr ML, St Leger AS, Bevan C, Merrett TG.

It is a serious global health problem affecting all age groups, with increasing prevalence in many developing countries, rising treatment costs, and a rising burden for patients and the community. Asthma still imposes an unacceptable burden on health care systems, and on society through loss of productivity in the workplace and, especially for pediatric asthma, disruption to the family. </p><p>Health care providers managing asthma face different issues around the world, depending on the local context, the health system, and access to resources. </p><p>The <b>Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA)</b> was established to increase awareness about asthma among health professionals, public health authorities and the community, and to improve prevention and management through a coordinated worldwide effort. GINA prepares scientific reports on asthma, encourages dissemination and implementation of the recommendations, and promotes international collaboration on asthma research. </p><p><b>The Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention </b>was extensively revised in 2014 to provide a comprehensive and integrated approach to asthma management that can be adapted for local conditions and for individual patients. It focuses not only on the existing strong evidence base, but also on clarity of language and on providing tools for feasible implementation in clinical practice. The report was updated in 2015. </p><p>This <b>Pocket Guide</b> is a brief summary of the GINA 2015 report for primary health care providers.

It causes respiratory symptoms, limitation of activity, and flare-ups (attacks) that sometimes require urgent health care and may be fatal. </p><p><b>Fortunately…asthma can be effectively treated</b>, and most patients can achieve good control of their asthma. When asthma is under good control, patients can: </p><p>• Avoid troublesome symptoms during day and night </p><p>• Need little or no reliever medication </p><p>• Have productive, physically active lives </p><p>• Have normal or near normal lung function </p><p>• Avoid serious asthma flare-ups (exacerbations, or attacks) </p><p><b>What is asthma? </b>Asthma causes symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough that vary over time in their occurrence, frequency and intensity. </p><p>These symptoms are associated with variable expiratory airflow, i.e. difficulty breathing air out of the lungs due to bronchoconstriction (airway narrowing), airway wall thickening, and increased mucus. Some variation in airflow can also occur in people without asthma, but it is greater in asthma. </p><p><b>Factors that may trigger or worsen asthma symptoms</b> include viral infections, domestic or occupational allergens (e.g. house dust mite, pollens, cockroach), tobacco smoke, exercise and stress. These responses are more likely when asthma is uncontrolled. Some drugs can induce or trigger asthma, e.g. beta-blockers, and (in some patients), aspirin or other NSAIDs. </p><p><b>Asthma flare-ups</b> (also called exacerbations or attacks) may occur, even in people taking asthma treatment. When asthma is uncontrolled, or in some high-risk patients, these episodes are more frequent and more severe, and may be fatal. </p><p><b>A stepwise approach to treatment</b>, customized to the individual patient, takes into account the effectiveness of available medications, their safety, and their cost to the payer or patient. </p><p><b>Regular controller treatment</b>, particularly with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)- containing medications, markedly reduces the frequency and severity of asthma symptoms and the risk of having a flare-up. </p><p>Asthma is a common condition, affecting all levels of society. Olympic athletes, famous leaders and celebrities, and ordinary people live <b>successful and active lives with asthma</b>. <b> </b>PY RI GH TE D M AT ER IA L </p><p>- D O NO T AL TE R OR\nR EP\n</p><p>RO DU\n</p><p>Asthma is a disease with many variations (heterogeneous), usually characterized by chronic airway inflammation. Asthma has two key defining features: </p><p>• a history of respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough that vary over time and in intensity, AND </p><p>• variable expiratory airflow limitation. </p><p>A flow-chart for making the diagnosis in clinical practice is shown in Box 1, with the specific criteria for diagnosing asthma in Box 2. </p><p><b>Box 1. Diagnostic flow-chart for asthma in clinical practice </b> </p><p>The <b>diagnosis of asthma</b> should be confirmed and, for future reference, the evidence documented in the patient's notes. Depending on clinical urgency and access to resources, this should preferably be done before starting controller treatment. Confirming the diagnosis of asthma is more difficult after treatment has been started (see p7). PY RI GH TE D M AT ER IA L </p><p>- D O NO T AL TE R OR\nR EP\n</p><p>RO DU\n</p><p><b>Box 2. Features used in making the diagnosis of asthma </b></p><p><b>1. A history of variable respiratory symptoms </b></p><p>Typical symptoms are wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, cough </p><p>• People with asthma generally have more than one of these symptoms </p><p>• The symptoms occur variably over time and vary in intensity </p><p>• The symptoms often occur or are worse at night or on waking </p><p>• Symptoms are often triggered by exercise, laughter, allergens or cold air </p><p>• Symptoms often occur with or worsen with viral infections </p><p><b>2. Evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation </b></p><p>• At least once during the diagnostic process when FEV1 is low, document that the FEV1/FVC ratio is reduced. The FEV1/FVC ratio is normally more than 0.75-0.80 in adults, and more than 0.90 in children. </p><p>• Document that variation in lung function is greater than in healthy people. For example: </p><p>o FEV1 increases by more than 12% and 200mL (in children, >12% of the predicted value) after inhaling a bronchodilator. This is called 'bronchodilator reversibility'. </p><p>o Average daily diurnal PEF variability* is >10% (in children, >13%) </p><p>o FEV1 increases by more than 12% and 200mL from baseline (in children, by >12% of the predicted value) after 4 weeks of anti-inflammatory treatment (outside respiratory infections) </p><p>• The greater the variation, or the more times excess variation is seen, the more confident you can be of the diagnosis </p><p>• Testing may need to be repeated during symptoms, in the early morning, or after withholding bronchodilator medications. </p><p>• Bronchodilator reversibility may be absent during severe exacerbations or viral infections. If bronchodilator reversibility is not present when it is first tested, the next step depends on the clinical urgency and availability of other tests. </p><p>• For other tests to assist in diagnosis, including bronchial challenge tests, see Chapter 1 of the GINA 2015 report. </p><p>*Calculated from twice daily readings (best of 3 each time), as ([the day's highest PEF minus the day's lowest PEF]) divided by the mean of the day's highest and lowest PEF, and averaged over 1-2 weeks. If using PEF at home or in the office, use the same PEF meter each time. </p><p><b>Physical examination</b> in people with asthma is often normal, but the most frequent finding is wheezing on auscultation, especially on forced expiration. <b> </b>PY RI GH TE D M AT ER IA L </p><p>- D O NO T AL TE R OR\nR EP\n</p><p>RO DU\n</p><p><b>Patients with cough as the only respiratory symptom </b></p><p>This may be due to chronic upper airway cough syndrome ('post-nasal drip'), chronic sinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), vocal cord dysfunction, or eosinophilic bronchitis, or cough variant asthma. Cough variant asthma is characterized by cough and airway hyperresponsiveness, and documenting variability in lung function is essential to make this diagnosis. However, lack of variability at the time of testing does not exclude asthma. For other diagnostic tests, see Box 2, and Chapter 1 of the GINA 2015 report, or refer the patient for specialist opinion. </p><p><b>Occupational asthma and work-aggravated asthma </b></p><p>Every patient with adult-onset asthma should be asked about occupational exposures, and whether their asthma is better when they are away from work. It is important to confirm the diagnosis objectively (which often needs specialist referral) and to eliminate exposure as soon as possible. </p><p><b>Pregnant women </b></p><p>Ask all pregnant women and those planning pregnancy about asthma, and advise them about the importance of asthma treatment for the health of both mother and baby. </p><p><b>The elderly </b></p><p>Asthma may be under-diagnosed in the elderly, due to poor perception, an assumption that dyspnea is normal in old age, lack of fitness, or reduced activity. Asthma may also be over-diagnosed in the elderly through confusion with shortness of breath due to left ventricular failure or ischemic heart disease. If there is a history of smoking or biomass fuel exposure, COPD or asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS) should be considered (see Chapter 5 of the GINA 2015 report). </p><p><b>Smokers and ex-smokers </b></p><p>Asthma and COPD may co-exist or overlap (asthma-COPD overlap syndrome, ACOS), particularly in smokers and the elderly. The history and pattern of symptoms and past records can help to distinguish asthma with fixed airflow limitation from COPD. Uncertainty in diagnosis should prompt early referral, as ACOS has worse outcomes than asthma or COPD alone. </p><p><b>Confirming an asthma diagnosis in patients taking controller treatment</b>: </p><p>For many patients (25-35%) with a diagnosis of asthma in primary care, the diagnosis cannot be confirmed. If the basis of the diagnosis has not already been documented, confirmation with objective testing should be sought.

If the patient has frequent symptoms, consider a trial of step-up in controller treatment and repeat lung function testing after 3 months. If the patient has few symptoms, consider stepping down controller treatment, but ensure the patient has a written asthma action plan, monitor them carefully, and repeat lung function testing. </p><p><b>ASSESSING A PATIENT WITH ASTHMA </b></p><p>Take every opportunity to assess patients with a diagnosis of asthma, particularly when they are symptomatic or after a recent exacerbation, but also when they ask for a prescription refill. In addition, schedule a routine review at least once a year. </p><p><b>Box 3. How to assess a patient with asthma </b></p><p><b>1.

Mild asthma is asthma that can be controlled with Step 1 or 2 treatment. Severe asthma is asthma that requires Step 4 or 5 treatment, to maintain symptom control. It may appear similar to asthma that is uncontrolled due to lack of treatment. </p><p><b>HOW TO INVESTIGATE UNCONTROLLED ASTHMA </b></p><p>Most patients can achieve good asthma control with regular controller treatment, but some patients do not, and further investigation is needed. </p><p><b>Box 5.

The aim is to reduce the burden to the patient and their risk of exacerbations, airway damage, and medication side-effects. The patient's own goals regarding their asthma and its treatment should also be identified. </p><p><b>Population-level recommendations</b> about 'preferred' asthma treatments represent the best treatment for most patients in a population. </p><p><b>Patient-level treatment decisions</b> should take into account any individual characteristics or phenotype that predict the patient's likely response to treatment, together with the patient's preferences and practical issues such as inhaler technique, adherence, and cost. </p><p>A <b>partnership</b> between the patient and their health care providers is important for effective asthma management. Training health care providers in <b>communication skills</b> may lead to increased patient satisfaction, better health outcomes, and reduced use of health care resources. </p><p><b>Health literacy</b> - that is, the patient's ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information to make appropriate health decisions - should be taken into account in asthma management and education. </p><p><b>TREATING TO CONTROL SYMPTOMS AND MINIMIZE RISK </b></p><p>Treatment of asthma for symptom control and risk reduction includes: </p><p>• Medications.

This contributes to poor symptom control and exacerbations. To ensure effective inhaler use: </p><p>• <b>Choose</b> the most appropriate device for the patient before prescribing: consider medication, physical problems e.g. arthritis, patient skills, and cost; for ICS by pressurized metered dose inhaler, prescribe a spacer. </p><p>• <b>Check</b> inhaler technique at every opportunity. Ask the patient to show you how they use the inhaler. Check their technique against a device-specific checklist. </p><p>• <b>Correct </b>using a physical demonstration, paying attention to incorrect steps.

Poor adherence contributes to poor symptom control and exacerbations. It may be unintentional (e.g. forgetfulness, cost, misunderstandings) and/or non-intentional (e.g. not perceiving the need for treatment, fear of side-effects, cultural issues, cost). </p><p>To identify patients with adherence problems: </p><p>• Ask an empathic question, e.g. \"Most patients don't take their inhaler exactly as prescribed. In the last 4 weeks, how many days a week have you been taking it? 0 days a week, or 1, or 2 days [etc]?\", or \"Do you find it easier to remember your inhaler in the morning or night?\" </p><p>• Check medication usage, from prescription date, inhaler date/dose counter, dispensing records </p><p>• Ask about attitudes and beliefs about asthma and medications </p><p>Only a few adherence interventions have been studied closely in asthma. </p><p>• Shared decision-making for medication and dose choice </p><p>• Inhaler reminders for missed doses </p><p>• Reduced complexity of the regimen (once- vs twice-daily) </p><p>• Comprehensive asthma education with home visits by asthma nurses </p><p>• Clinicians reviewing feedback on their patients' dispensing records <b> </b>PY RI GH TE D M AT ER IA L </p><p>- D O NO T AL TE R OR\nR EP\n</p><p>RO DU\n</p><p>Exacerbation risk can be minimized by optimizing asthma medications, and by identifying and treating modifiable risk factors. Some examples of risk modifiers with consistent high quality evidence are: </p><p>• <b>Guided self-management</b>: self-monitoring of symptoms and/or PEF, a written asthma action plan (p22), and regular medical review<b> </b></p><p>• <b>Use of a regimen that minimizes exacerbations</b>: prescribe an ICS-containing controller. For patients with 1 or more exacerbations in the last year, consider a low dose ICS/formoterol maintenance and reliever regimen<b> </b></p><p>• <b>Avoidance of exposure to tobacco smoke </b></p><p>• <b>Confirmed food allergy</b>: appropriate food avoidance; ensure availability of injectable epinephrine for anaphylaxis<b> </b></p><p>• <b>For patients with severe asthma</b>: refer to a specialist center, if available, for consideration of add-on medications and/or sputum-guided treatment. </p><p><b>NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL STRATEGIES AND INTERVENTIONS </b></p><p>In addition to medications, other therapies and strategies may be considered where relevant, to assist in symptom control and risk reduction. Some examples with consistent high quality evidence are: </p><p>• <b>Smoking cessation advice</b>: at every visit, strongly encourage smokers to quit. Provide access to counselling and resources. Advise parents and carers to exclude smoking in rooms/cars used by children with asthma </p><p>• <b>Physical activity</b>: encourage people with asthma to engage in regular physical activity because of its general health benefits. Provide advice about management of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. </p><p>• <b>Occupational asthma</b>: ask all patients with adult-onset asthma about their work history. Identify and remove occupational sensitizers as soon as possible. Refer patients for expert advice, if available. </p><p>• <b>NSAIDs including aspirin</b>: always ask about asthma before prescribing. </p><p>Although allergens may contribute to asthma symptoms in sensitized patients, allergen avoidance is not recommended as a general strategy for asthma. These strategies are often complex and expensive, and there are no validated methods for identifying those who are likely to benefit. </p><p>Some common triggers for asthma symptoms (e.g. exercise, laughter) should <b>not</b> be avoided, and others (e.g. viral respiratory infections, stress) are difficult to avoid and should be managed when they occur. <b> </b>PY RI GH TE D M AT ER IA L </p><p>- D O NO T AL TE R OR\nR EP\n</p><p>RO DU\nmother, the advantages of actively treating asthma markedly outweigh any potential risks of usual controller and reliever medications. Down-titration has a low priority in pregnancy. Exacerbations should be treated aggressively. </p><p><b>Rhinitis and sinusitis</b> often coexist with asthma. Chronic rhinosinusitis is associated with more severe asthma. For some patients, treatment with intranasal corticosteroids improves asthma control. </p><p><b>Obesity</b>: to avoid over- or under-treatment, it is important to document the diagnosis of asthma in the obese. Asthma is more difficult to control in obesity. Weight reduction should be included in the treatment plan for obese patients with asthma; even 5-10% weight loss can improve asthma control. </p><p><b>The elderly</b>: comorbidities and their treatment should be considered and may complicate asthma management. Factors such as arthritis, eyesight, inspiratory flow, and complexity of treatment regimens should be considered when choosing medications and inhaler devices. </p><p><b>Gastroesophageal reflux </b>(GERD) is commonly seen in asthma. Symptomatic reflux should be treated for its general health benefits, but there is no benefit from treating asymptomatic reflux in asthma. </p><p><b>Anxiety and depression</b>: these are commonly seen in people with asthma, and are associated with worse symptoms and quality of life. Patients should be assisted to distinguish between symptoms of anxiety and of asthma. </p><p><b>Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease </b>(AERD): a history of exacerbation following ingestion of aspirin or other NSAIDs is highly suggestive. Patients often have severe asthma and nasal polyposis. Confirmation of the diagnosis of AERD requires challenge in a specialized center with cardiopulmonary resuscitation facilities, but avoidance of NSAIDs may be recommended on the basis of a clear history. ICS are the mainstay of treatment, but OCS may be required. Desensitization under specialist care is sometimes effective. </p><p><b>Food allergy and anaphylaxis</b>: food allergy is rarely a trigger for asthma symptoms. It must be assessed with specialist testing. Confirmed food allergy is a risk factor for asthma-related death. Good asthma control is essential; patients should also have an anaphylaxis plan and be trained in appropriate avoidance strategies and use of injectable epinephrine. </p><p><b>Surgery</b>: whenever possible, good asthma control should be achieved preoperatively. Ensure that controller therapy is maintained throughout the peri-operative period. Patients on long-term high dose ICS, or having more than 2 weeks' OCS in the past 6 months, should receive intra-operative hydrocortisone to reduce the risk of adrenal crisis.

PY RI GH TE D M AT ER IA L\n\n- D O NO T AL TE R OR R EP\n\nRO DU\n\nAsthma affects an estimated 300 million individuals worldwide. It is a serious global health problem affecting all age groups, with increasing prevalence in many developing countries, rising treatment costs, and a rising burden for patients and the community. Asthma still imposes an unacceptable burden on health care systems, and on society through loss of productivity in the workplace and, especially for pediatric asthma, disruption to the family.\n\nHealth care providers managing asthma face different issues around the world, depending on the local context, the health system, and access to resources.\n\nThe Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established to increase awareness about asthma among health professionals, public health authorities and the community, and to improve prevention and management through a coordinated worldwide effort. GINA prepares scientific reports on asthma, encourages dissemination and implementation of the recommendations, and promotes international collaboration on asthma research.\n\nThe Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention was extensively revised in 2014 to provide a comprehensive and integrated approach to asthma management that can be adapted for local conditions and for individual patients. It focuses not only on the existing strong evidence base, but also on clarity of language and on providing tools for feasible implementation in clinical practice. The report was updated in 2015.\n\nThis Pocket Guide is a brief summary of the GINA 2015 report for primary health care providers. It does NOT contain all of the information required for managing asthma, for example, about safety of treatments, and should be used in conjunction with the full GINA 2015 report. GINA cannot be held liable or responsible for healthcare administered with the use of this document, including any use which is not in accordance with applicable local or national regulations or guidelines.\n\nThe GINA 2015 report and other GINA publications (listed on page 28) can be obtained from www.ginasthma.org. PY RI GH TE D M AT ER IA L\n\n- D O NO T AL TE R OR R EP\n\nRO DU\n\nAsthma is a common and potentially serious chronic disease that imposes a substantial burden on patients, their families and the community. It causes respiratory symptoms, limitation of activity, and flare-ups (attacks) that sometimes require urgent health care and may be fatal.\n\nFortunately…asthma can be effectively treated, and most patients can achieve good control of their asthma. When asthma is under good control, patients can:\n\n• Avoid troublesome symptoms during day and night\n\n• Need little or no reliever medication\n\n• Have productive, physically active lives\n\n• Have normal or near normal lung function\n\n• Avoid serious asthma flare-ups (exacerbations, or attacks)\n\nWhat is asthma? Asthma causes symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough that vary over time in their occurrence, frequency and intensity.\n\nThese symptoms are associated with variable expiratory airflow, i.e. difficulty breathing air out of the lungs due to bronchoconstriction (airway narrowing), airway wall thickening, and increased mucus. Some variation in airflow can also occur in people without asthma, but it is greater in asthma.\n\nFactors that may trigger or worsen asthma symptoms include viral infections, domestic or occupational allergens (e.g. house dust mite, pollens, cockroach), tobacco smoke, exercise and stress. These responses are more likely when asthma is uncontrolled. Some drugs can induce or trigger asthma, e.g. beta-blockers, and (in some patients), aspirin or other NSAIDs.\n\nAsthma flare-ups (also called exacerbations or attacks) may occur, even in people taking asthma treatment. When asthma is uncontrolled, or in some high-risk patients, these episodes are more frequent and more severe, and may be fatal.\n\nA stepwise approach to treatment, customized to the individual patient, takes into account the effectiveness of available medications, their safety, and their cost to the payer or patient.\n\nRegular controller treatment, particularly with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)- containing medications, markedly reduces the frequency and severity of asthma symptoms and the risk of having a flare-up.\n\nAsthma is a common condition, affecting all levels of society. Olympic athletes, famous leaders and celebrities, and ordinary people live successful and active lives with asthma.  PY RI GH TE D M AT ER IA L\n\n- D O NO T AL TE R OR R EP\n\nRO DU\n\nAsthma is a disease with many variations (heterogeneous), usually characterized by chronic airway inflammation. Asthma has two key defining features:\n\n• a history of respiratory symptoms such as wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness and cough that vary over time and in intensity, AND\n\n• variable expiratory airflow limitation.\n\nA flow-chart for making the diagnosis in clinical practice is shown in Box 1, with the specific criteria for diagnosing asthma in Box 2.\n\nBox 1. Diagnostic flow-chart for asthma in clinical practice\n\nThe diagnosis of asthma should be confirmed and, for future reference, the evidence documented in the patient's notes. Depending on clinical urgency and access to resources, this should preferably be done before starting controller treatment. Confirming the diagnosis of asthma is more difficult after treatment has been started (see p7). PY RI GH TE D M AT ER IA L\n\n- D O NO T AL TE R OR R EP\n\nRO DU\n\nBox 2. Features used in making the diagnosis of asthma\n\n1. A history of variable respiratory symptoms\n\nTypical symptoms are wheeze, shortness of breath, chest tightness, cough\n\n• People with asthma generally have more than one of these symptoms\n\n• The symptoms occur variably over time and vary in intensity\n\n• The symptoms often occur or are worse at night or on waking\n\n• Symptoms are often triggered by exercise, laughter, allergens or cold air\n\n• Symptoms often occur with or worsen with viral infections\n\n2. Evidence of variable expiratory airflow limitation\n\n• At least once during the diagnostic process when FEV1 is low, document that the FEV1/FVC ratio is reduced. The FEV1/FVC ratio is normally more than 0.75-0.80 in adults, and more than 0.90 in children.\n\n• Document that variation in lung function is greater than in healthy people. For example:\n\no FEV1 increases by more than 12% and 200mL (in children, >12% of the predicted value) after inhaling a bronchodilator. This is called 'bronchodilator reversibility'.\n\no Average daily diurnal PEF variability* is >10% (in children, >13%)\n\no FEV1 increases by more than 12% and 200mL from baseline (in children, by >12% of the predicted value) after 4 weeks of anti-inflammatory treatment (outside respiratory infections)\n\n• The greater the variation, or the more times excess variation is seen, the more confident you can be of the diagnosis\n\n• Testing may need to be repeated during symptoms, in the early morning, or after withholding bronchodilator medications.\n\n• Bronchodilator reversibility may be absent during severe exacerbations or viral infections. If bronchodilator reversibility is not present when it is first tested, the next step depends on the clinical urgency and availability of other tests.\n\n• For other tests to assist in diagnosis, including bronchial challenge tests, see Chapter 1 of the GINA 2015 report.\n\n*Calculated from twice daily readings (best of 3 each time), as ([the day's highest PEF minus the day's lowest PEF]) divided by the mean of the day's highest and lowest PEF, and averaged over 1-2 weeks. If using PEF at home or in the office, use the same PEF meter each time.\n\nPhysical examination in people with asthma is often normal, but the most frequent finding is wheezing on auscultation, especially on forced expiration.  PY RI GH TE D M AT ER IA L\n\n- D O NO T AL TE R OR R EP\n\nRO DU\n\nPatients with cough as the only respiratory symptom\n\nThis may be due to chronic upper airway cough syndrome ('post-nasal drip'), chronic sinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), vocal cord dysfunction, or eosinophilic bronchitis, or cough variant asthma. Cough variant asthma is characterized by cough and airway hyperresponsiveness, and documenting variability in lung function is essential to make this diagnosis. However, lack of variability at the time of testing does not exclude asthma. For other diagnostic tests, see Box 2, and Chapter 1 of the GINA 2015 report, or refer the patient for specialist opinion.\n\nOccupational asthma and work-aggravated asthma\n\nEvery patient with adult-onset asthma should be asked about occupational exposures, and whether their asthma is better when they are away from work. It is important to confirm the diagnosis objectively (which often needs specialist referral) and to eliminate exposure as soon as possible.\n\nPregnant women\n\nAsk all pregnant women and those planning pregnancy about asthma, and advise them about the importance of asthma treatment for the health of both mother and baby.\n\nThe elderly\n\nAsthma may be under-diagnosed in the elderly, due to poor perception, an assumption that dyspnea is normal in old age, lack of fitness, or reduced activity. Asthma may also be over-diagnosed in the elderly through confusion with shortness of breath due to left ventricular failure or ischemic heart disease. If there is a history of smoking or biomass fuel exposure, COPD or asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS) should be considered (see Chapter 5 of the GINA 2015 report).\n\nSmokers and ex-smokers\n\nAsthma and COPD may co-exist or overlap (asthma-COPD overlap syndrome, ACOS), particularly in smokers and the elderly. The history and pattern of symptoms and past records can help to distinguish asthma with fixed airflow limitation from COPD. Uncertainty in diagnosis should prompt early referral, as ACOS has worse outcomes than asthma or COPD alone.\n\nConfirming an asthma diagnosis in patients taking controller treatment:\n\nFor many patients (25-35%) with a diagnosis of asthma in primary care, the diagnosis cannot be confirmed. If the basis of the diagnosis has not already been documented, confirmation with objective testing should be sought. PY RI GH TE D M AT ER IA L\n\n- D O NO T AL TE R OR R EP\n\nRO DU testing after withholding medications for 12 hours. If the patient has frequent symptoms, consider a trial of step-up in controller treatment and repeat lung function testing after 3 months. If the patient has few symptoms, consider stepping down controller treatment, but ensure the patient has a written asthma action plan, monitor them carefully, and repeat lung function testing.\n\nASSESSING A PATIENT WITH ASTHMA\n\nTake every opportunity to assess patients with a diagnosis of asthma, particularly when they are symptomatic or after a recent exacerbation, but also when they ask for a prescription refill. In addition, schedule a routine review at least once a year.\n\nBox 3. How to assess a patient with asthma\n\n1. Asthma control - assess both symptom control and risk factors\n\n• Assess symptom control over the last 4 weeks (Box 4, p9)\n\n• Identify any other risk factors for poor outcomes (Box 4)\n\n• Measure lung function before starting treatment, 3-6 months later, and then periodically, e.g. yearly\n\n2. Treatment issues\n\n• Record the patient's treatment (Box 7, p14), and ask about side-effects\n\n• Watch the patient using their inhaler, to check their technique (p18)\n\n• Have an open empathic discussion about adherence (p18)\n\n• Check that the patient has a written asthma action plan (p22)\n\n• Ask the patient about their attitudes and goals for their asthma\n\n3. Are there any comorbidities?\n\n• These include rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, depression and anxiety.\n\n• Comorbidities should be identified as they may contribute to respiratory symptoms and poor quality of life. Their treatment may complicate asthma management.  PY RI GH TE D M AT ER IA L\n\n- D O NO T AL TE R OR R EP\n\nRO DU in the patient, or have been reduced or removed by treatment. Asthma control has two domains: symptom control (previously called 'current clinical control') and risk factors for future poor outcomes.\n\nPoor symptom control is a burden to patients and a risk factor for flare-ups. Risk factors are factors that increase the patient's future risk of having exacerbations (flare-ups), loss of lung function, or medication side-effects.\n\nBox 4. Assessment of symptom control and future risk\n\nA.

Risk factors for poor asthma outcomes\n\nAssess risk factors at diagnosis and periodically, particularly for patients experiencing exacerbations.\n\nMeasure FEV1 at start of treatment, after 3-6 months of controller treatment to record personal best lung function, then periodically for ongoing risk assessment.\n\nPotentially modifiable independent risk factors for exacerbations include:\n\n• Uncontrolled asthma symptoms (as above)\n\n• ICS not prescribed; poor ICS adherence; incorrect inhaler technique\n\n• High SABA use (with increased mortality if >1x200-dose canister/month)\n\n• Low FEV1, especially if <60% predicted\n\n• Major psychological or socioeconomic problems\n\n• Exposures: smoking; allergen exposure if sensitized\n\n• Comorbidities: obesity; rhinosinusitis; confirmed food allergy\n\n• Sputum or blood eosinophilia\n\n• Pregnancy\n\nOther major independent risk factors for flare-ups (exacerbations) include:\n\n• Ever being intubated or in intensive care for asthma\n\n• Having 1 or more severe exacerbations in the last 12 months.\n\nRisk factors for developing fixed airflow limitation include lack of ICS treatment; exposure to tobacco smoke, noxious chemicals or occupational exposures; low FEV1; chronic mucus hypersecretion; and sputum or blood eosinophilia\n\nRisk factors for medication side-effects include:\n\n• Systemic: frequent OCS; long-term, high dose and/or potent ICS; also taking P450 inhibitors\n\n• Local: high-dose or potent ICS; poor inhaler technique\n\nHaving one or more of these risk factors increases the risk of exacerbations even if symptoms are well controlled.

Patients who have either few or many symptoms relative to their lung function need more investigation.\n\nHow is asthma severity assessed?\n\nAsthma severity can be assessed retrospectively from the level of treatment (p14) required to control symptoms and exacerbations. Mild asthma is asthma that can be controlled with Step 1 or 2 treatment. Severe asthma is asthma that requires Step 4 or 5 treatment, to maintain symptom control. It may appear similar to asthma that is uncontrolled due to lack of treatment.\n\nHOW TO INVESTIGATE UNCONTROLLED ASTHMA\n\nMost patients can achieve good asthma control with regular controller treatment, but some patients do not, and further investigation is needed.\n\nBox 5. How to investigate uncontrolled asthma in primary care\n\nThis flow-chart shows the most common problems first, but the steps can be carried out in a different order, depending on resources and clinical context. PY RI GH TE D M AT ER IA L\n\n- D O NO T AL TE R OR R EP\n\nRO DU\n\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES\n\nThe long-term goals of asthma management are symptom control and risk reduction. The aim is to reduce the burden to the patient and their risk of exacerbations, airway damage, and medication side-effects. The patient's own goals regarding their asthma and its treatment should also be identified.\n\nPopulation-level recommendations about 'preferred' asthma treatments represent the best treatment for most patients in a population.\n\nPatient-level treatment decisions should take into account any individual characteristics or phenotype that predict the patient's likely response to treatment, together with the patient's preferences and practical issues such as inhaler technique, adherence, and cost.\n\nA partnership between the patient and their health care providers is important for effective asthma management. Training health care providers in communication skills may lead to increased patient satisfaction, better health outcomes, and reduced use of health care resources.\n\nHealth literacy - that is, the patient's ability to obtain, process and understand basic health information to make appropriate health decisions - should be taken into account in asthma management and education.\n\nTREATING TO CONTROL SYMPTOMS AND MINIMIZE RISK\n\nTreatment of asthma for symptom control and risk reduction includes:\n\n• Medications. Every patient with asthma should have a reliever medication, and most adults and adolescents with asthma should have a controller medication\n\n• Treating modifiable risk factors\n\n• Non-pharmacological therapies and strategies\n\nImportantly, every patient should also be trained in essential skills and guided asthma self-management, including:\n\n• Asthma information\n\n• Inhaler skills (p18)\n\n• Adherence (p18)\n\n• Written asthma action plan (p22)\n\n• Self-monitoring\n\n• Regular medical review (p8) PY RI GH TE D M AT ER IA L\n\n- D O NO T AL TE R OR R EP\n\nRO DU treatment and review response. The main components of this cycle are shown in Box 6.\n\nBox 6. The control-based asthma management cycle   PY RI GH TE D M AT ER IA L\n\n- D O NO T AL TE R OR R EP\n\nRO DU\n\nFor the best outcomes, regular daily controller treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after the diagnosis of asthma is made, because:\n\n• Early treatment with low dose ICS leads to better lung function than if symptoms have been present for more than 2-4 years\n\n• Patients not taking ICS who experience a severe exacerbation have lower long-term lung function than those who have started ICS\n\n• In occupational asthma, early removal from exposure and early treatment increase the probability of recovery\n\nRegular low dose ICS is recommended for patients with any of the following:\n\n• Asthma symptoms more than twice a month\n\n• Waking due to asthma more than once a month\n\n• Any asthma symptoms plus any risk factor(s) for exacerbations (e.g. needing OCS for asthma within the last 12 months; low FEV1; ever in intensive care unit for asthma)\n\nConsider starting at a higher step (e.g. medium/high dose ICS, or ICS/LABA) if the patient has troublesome asthma symptoms on most days; or is waking from asthma once or more a week, especially if there are any risk factors for exacerbations.\n\nIf the initial asthma presentation is with severely uncontrolled asthma, or with an acute exacerbation, give a short course of OCS and start regular controller treatment (e.g. high dose ICS, or medium dose ICS/LABA).\n\nLow, medium and high dose categories for different ICS medications are shown in Box 8 (p14).\n\nBefore starting initial controller treatment\n\n• Record evidence for the diagnosis of asthma, if possible\n\n• Document symptom control and risk factors\n\n• Assess lung function, when possible\n\n• Train the patient to use the inhaler correctly, and check their technique\n\n• Schedule a follow-up visit\n\nAfter starting initial controller treatment\n\n• Review response after 2-3 months, or according to clinical urgency\n\n• See Box 7 for ongoing treatment and other key management issues\n\n• Consider step down when asthma has been well-controlled for 3 months PY RI GH TE D M AT ER IA L\n\n- D O NO T AL TE R OR R EP\n\nRO DU\n\nBox 7. Stepwise approach to asthma treatment\n\n*For children 6-11 years, theophylline is not recommended, and the preferred Step 3 treatment is medium dose ICS.\n\n**Low dose ICS/formoterol is the reliever medication for patients prescribed low dose budesonide/formoterol or low dose beclometasone/formoterol ## Tiotropium by soft-mist inhaler is an add-on treatment for patients with a history of exacerbations; it is not indicated in children <18 years.\n\nFor medication Glossary, see p26. For details about treatment recommendations, supporting evidence, and clinical advice about implementation in different populations see the full GINA 2015 report (www.ginasthma.org). E D M AT ER IA L\n\n- D O NO T AL TE R OR R EP\n\nRO DU CE\n\nOnce asthma treatment has been started, ongoing decisions are based on a cycle to assess, adjust treatment and review response. The preferred treatments at each step are summarized below and in Box 7 (p14); for details, see full GINA 2015 report. See Box 8 (p14) for ICS dose categories.\n\nSTEP 1: As-needed SABA with no controller (this is indicated only if symptoms are rare, there is no night waking due to asthma, no exacerbations in the last year, and normal FEV1).\n\nOther options: regular low dose ICS for patients with exacerbation risks.\n\nSTEP 2: Regular low dose ICS plus as-needed SABA\n\nOther options: LTRA are less effective than ICS; ICS/LABA leads to faster improvement in symptoms and FEV1 than ICS alone but are more expensive and the exacerbation rate is similar. For purely seasonal allergic asthma, start ICS immediately and cease 4 weeks after end of exposure.\n\nSTEP 3: Low dose ICS/LABA either as maintenance treatment plus as-needed SABA, or as ICS/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy\n\nFor patients with ≥1 exacerbation in the last year, low dose BDP/formoterol or BUD/formoterol maintenance and reliever strategy is more effective than maintenance ICS/LABA with as-needed SABA.\n\nOther options: Medium dose ICS\n\nChildren (6-11 years): Medium dose ICS. Other options: low dose ICS/LABA\n\nSTEP 4: Low dose ICS/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy, or\n\nmedium dose ICS/LABA as maintenance plus as-needed SABA\n\nOther options: Add-on tiotropium by soft-mist inhaler for adults (≥18 years) with a history of exacerbations; high dose ICS/LABA, but more side-effects and little extra benefit; extra controller, e.g. LTRA or slow-release theophylline (adults)\n\nChildren (6-11 years): Refer for expert assessment and advice.\n\nSTEP 5: Refer for expert investigation and add-on treatment\n\nAdd-on treatments include anti-IgE (omalizumab) for severe allergic asthma. Sputum-guided treatment, if available, improves outcomes.\n\nOther options: Add-on tiotropium by soft-mist inhaler for adults (≥18 years) with a history of exacerbations. Some patients may benefit from low dose OCS but long-term systemic side-effects occur.  PY RI GH TE D M AT ER IA L\n\n- D O NO T AL TE R OR R EP\n\nRO DU\n\nPatients should preferably be seen 1-3 months after starting treatment and every 3-12 months after that, except in pregnancy when they should be reviewed every 4-6 weeks. After an exacerbation, a review visit within 1 week should be scheduled. The frequency of review depends on the patient's initial level of control, their response to previous treatment, and their ability and willingness to engage in self-management with an action plan.\n\nStepping up asthma treatment\n\nAsthma is a variable condition, and periodic adjustment of controller treatment by the clinician and/or patient may be needed.\n\n• Sustained step-up (for at least 2-3 months): if symptoms and/or exacerbations persist despite 2-3 months of controller treatment, assess the following common issues before considering a step-up\n\no Incorrect inhaler technique\n\no Poor adherence\n\no Modifiable risk factors, e.g. smoking\n\no Are symptoms due to comorbid conditions, e.g. allergic rhinitis\n\n• Short-term step-up (for 1-2 weeks) by clinician or by patient with written asthma action plan (p22), e.g. during viral infection or allergen exposure\n\n• Day-to-day adjustment by patient for patients prescribed low dose beclometasone/formoterol or budesonide/formoterol as maintenance and reliever therapy.\n\nStepping down treatment when asthma is well-controlled\n\nConsider stepping down treatment once good asthma control has been achieved and maintained for 3 months, to find the lowest treatment that controls both symptoms and exacerbations, and minimizes side-effects.\n\n• Choose an appropriate time for step-down (no respiratory infection, patient not travelling, not pregnant)\n\n• Document baseline status (symptom control and lung function), provide a written asthma action plan, monitor closely, and book a follow-up visit\n\n• Step down through available formulations to reduce the ICS dose by 25-50% at 2-3 month intervals (see full GINA report for details)\n\n• Do not completely withdraw ICS (in adults or adolescents) unless it is needed temporarily to confirm the diagnosis of asthma  PY RI GH TE D M AT ER IA L\n\n- D O NO T AL TE R OR R EP\n\nRO DU\n\nMost patients (up to 80%) cannot use their inhaler correctly. This contributes to poor symptom control and exacerbations. To ensure effective inhaler use:\n\n• Choose the most appropriate device for the patient before prescribing: consider medication, physical problems e.g. arthritis, patient skills, and cost; for ICS by pressurized metered dose inhaler, prescribe a spacer.\n\n• Check inhaler technique at every opportunity. Ask the patient to show you how they use the inhaler. Check their technique against a device-specific checklist.\n\n• Correct using a physical demonstration, paying attention to incorrect steps. Check technique again, up to 2-3 times if necessary.\n\n• Confirm that you have checklists for each of the inhalers you prescribe, and can demonstrate correct technique on them.\n\nInformation about inhaler devices and techniques for their use can be found on the GINA website (www.ginasthma.org) and the ADMIT website (www.admit-inhalers.org).\n\nCheck and improve adherence with asthma medications\n\nAround 50% of adults and children do not take controller medications as prescribed. Poor adherence contributes to poor symptom control and exacerbations. It may be unintentional (e.g. forgetfulness, cost, misunderstandings) and/or non-intentional (e.g. not perceiving the need for treatment, fear of side-effects, cultural issues, cost).\n\nTo identify patients with adherence problems:\n\n• Ask an empathic question, e.g. \"Most patients don't take their inhaler exactly as prescribed. In the last 4 weeks, how many days a week have you been taking it? 0 days a week, or 1, or 2 days [etc]?\", or \"Do you find it easier to remember your inhaler in the morning or night?\"\n\n• Check medication usage, from prescription date, inhaler date/dose counter, dispensing records\n\n• Ask about attitudes and beliefs about asthma and medications\n\nOnly a few adherence interventions have been studied closely in asthma.\n\n• Shared decision-making for medication and dose choice\n\n• Inhaler reminders for missed doses\n\n• Reduced complexity of the regimen (once- vs twice-daily)\n\n• Comprehensive asthma education with home visits by asthma nurses\n\n• Clinicians reviewing feedback on their patients' dispensing records  PY RI GH TE D M AT ER IA L\n\n- D O NO T AL TE R OR R EP\n\nRO DU\n\nExacerbation risk can be minimized by optimizing asthma medications, and by identifying and treating modifiable risk factors. Some examples of risk modifiers with consistent high quality evidence are:\n\n• Guided self-management: self-monitoring of symptoms and/or PEF, a written asthma action plan (p22), and regular medical review\n\n• Use of a regimen that minimizes exacerbations: prescribe an ICS-containing controller. For patients with 1 or more exacerbations in the last year, consider a low dose ICS/formoterol maintenance and reliever regimen\n\n• Avoidance of exposure to tobacco smoke\n\n• Confirmed food allergy: appropriate food avoidance; ensure availability of injectable epinephrine for anaphylaxis\n\n• For patients with severe asthma: refer to a specialist center, if available, for consideration of add-on medications and/or sputum-guided treatment.\n\nNON-PHARMACOLOGICAL STRATEGIES AND INTERVENTIONS\n\nIn addition to medications, other therapies and strategies may be considered where relevant, to assist in symptom control and risk reduction. Some examples with consistent high quality evidence are:\n\n• Smoking cessation advice: at every visit, strongly encourage smokers to quit. Provide access to counselling and resources. Advise parents and carers to exclude smoking in rooms/cars used by children with asthma\n\n• Physical activity: encourage people with asthma to engage in regular physical activity because of its general health benefits. Provide advice about management of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.\n\n• Occupational asthma: ask all patients with adult-onset asthma about their work history. Identify and remove occupational sensitizers as soon as possible. Refer patients for expert advice, if available.\n\n• NSAIDs including aspirin: always ask about asthma before prescribing.\n\nAlthough allergens may contribute to asthma symptoms in sensitized patients, allergen avoidance is not recommended as a general strategy for asthma. These strategies are often complex and expensive, and there are no validated methods for identifying those who are likely to benefit.\n\nSome common triggers for asthma symptoms (e.g. exercise, laughter) should not be avoided, and others (e.g. viral respiratory infections, stress) are difficult to avoid and should be managed when they occur.  PY RI GH TE D M AT ER IA L\n\n- D O NO T AL TE R OR R EP\n\nRO DU mother, the advantages of actively treating asthma markedly outweigh any potential risks of usual controller and reliever medications. Down-titration has a low priority in pregnancy. Exacerbations should be treated aggressively.\n\nRhinitis and sinusitis often coexist with asthma. Chronic rhinosinusitis is associated with more severe asthma. For some patients, treatment with intranasal corticosteroids improves asthma control.\n\nObesity: to avoid over- or under-treatment, it is important to document the diagnosis of asthma in the obese. Asthma is more difficult to control in obesity. Weight reduction should be included in the treatment plan for obese patients with asthma; even 5-10% weight loss can improve asthma control.\n\nThe elderly: comorbidities and their treatment should be considered and may complicate asthma management. Factors such as arthritis, eyesight, inspiratory flow, and complexity of treatment regimens should be considered when choosing medications and inhaler devices.\n\nGastroesophageal reflux (GERD) is commonly seen in asthma. Symptomatic reflux should be treated for its general health benefits, but there is no benefit from treating asymptomatic reflux in asthma.\n\nAnxiety and depression: these are commonly seen in people with asthma, and are associated with worse symptoms and quality of life. Patients should be assisted to distinguish between symptoms of anxiety and of asthma.\n\nAspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD): a history of exacerbation following ingestion of aspirin or other NSAIDs is highly suggestive. Patients often have severe asthma and nasal polyposis. Confirmation of the diagnosis of AERD requires challenge in a specialized center with cardiopulmonary resuscitation facilities, but avoidance of NSAIDs may be recommended on the basis of a clear history. ICS are the mainstay of treatment, but OCS may be required. Desensitization under specialist care is sometimes effective.\n\nFood allergy and anaphylaxis: food allergy is rarely a trigger for asthma symptoms. It must be assessed with specialist testing. Confirmed food allergy is a risk factor for asthma-related death. Good asthma control is essential; patients should also have an anaphylaxis plan and be trained in appropriate avoidance strategies and use of injectable epinephrine.\n\nSurgery: whenever possible, good asthma control should be achieved preoperatively. Ensure that controller therapy is maintained throughout the peri-operative period. Patients on long-term high dose ICS, or having more than 2 weeks' OCS in the past 6 months, should receive intra-operative hydrocortisone to reduce the risk of adrenal crisis.

'Episodes', 'attacks' and 'acute severe asthma' are often used, but they have variable meanings, particularly for patients.\n\nThe management of worsening asthma and exacerbations should be considered as a continuum, from self-management by the patient with a written asthma action plan, through to management of more severe symptoms in primary care, the emergency department and in hospital.\n\nIdentifying patients at risk of asthma-related death\n\nThese patients should be identified, and flagged for more frequent review.\n\n• A history of near-fatal asthma requiring intubation and ventilation\n\n• Hospitalization or emergency care for asthma in last 12 months\n\n• Not currently using ICS, or poor adherence with ICS\n\n• Currently using or recently stopped using OCS (this indicates the severity of recent events)\n\n• Over-use of SABAs, especially more than 1 canister/month\n\n• Lack of a written asthma action plan\n\n• History of psychiatric disease or psychosocial problems\n\n• Confirmed food allergy in a patient with asthma  PY RI GH TE D M AT ER IA L\n\n- D O NO T AL TE R OR R EP\n\nRO DU\n\nAll patients should be provided with a written asthma action plan appropriate for their level of asthma control and health literacy, so they know how to recognize and respond to worsening asthma.\n\nBox 9. Self-management with a written action plan\n\nThe written asthma action plan should include:\n\n• The patient's usual asthma medications\n\n• When and how to increase medications, and start OCS\n\n• How to access medical care if symptoms fail to respond\n\nThe action plan can be based on symptoms and/or (in adults) PEF. Patients who deteriorate quickly should be advised to go to an acute care facility or see their doctor immediately.\n\nMedication changes for written asthma action plans\n\nIncrease frequency of inhaled reliever (SABA, or low dose ICS/formoterol if using maintenance and reliever regimen); add spacer for pMDI.\n\nIncrease controller: Rapid increase in ICS component up to max. 2000mcg BDP equivalent. Options depend on usual controller medication, as follows:\n\n• ICS: At least double dose, consider increasing to high dose.\n\n• Maintenance ICS/formoterol: Quadruple maintenance ICS/formoterol dose (to maximum formoterol dose of 72 mcg/day).\n\n• Maintenance ICS/salmeterol: Step up at least to higher dose formulation; consider adding separate ICS inhaler to achieve high ICS dose.\n\n• Maintenance and reliever ICS/formoterol: Continue maintenance dose; increase as-needed ICS/formoterol (maximum formoterol 72 mcg/day).\n\nOral corticosteroids (preferably morning dosing):\n\n• Adults - prednisolone 1mg/kg/day up to 50mg, usually for 5-7 days.\n\n• For children, 1-2 mg/kg/day up to 40mg, usually for 3-5 days.\n\n• Tapering not needed if treatment has been given for less than 2 weeks.

For these patients, immediately give inhaled SABA, inhaled ipratropium bromide, oxygen and systemic corticosteroids.\n\nStart treatment with repeated doses of SABA (usually by pMDI and spacer), early oral corticosteroids, and controlled flow oxygen if available. Check response of symptoms and saturation frequently, and measure lung function after 1 hour. Titrate oxygen to maintain saturation of 93-95% in adults and adolescents (94-98% in children 6-12 years).\n\nFor severe exacerbations, add ipratropium bromide, and consider giving SABA by nebulizer. In acute care facilities, intravenous magnesium sulfate may be considered if the patient is not responding to intensive initial treatment.\n\nDo not routinely perform chest X-ray or blood gases, or prescribe antibiotics, for asthma exacerbations.\n\nREVIEWING RESPONSE\n\nMonitor patients closely and frequently during treatment, and titrate treatment according to response. Transfer the patient to higher level care if worsening or failing to respond.\n\nDecide about need for hospitalization based on clinical status, symptomatic and lung function, response to treatment, recent and past history of exacerbations, and ability to manage at home.\n\nBefore discharge, arrange ongoing treatment. For most patients, prescribe regular controller therapy (or increase current dose) to reduce the risk of further exacerbations. Continue increased controller doses for 2-4 weeks, and reduce reliever to as-needed. Check inhaler technique and adherence. Provide an interim written asthma action plan.\n\nArrange early follow-up after any exacerbation, preferably within 1 week.\n\nConsider referral for specialist advice for patients with an asthma hospitalization, or repeated emergency department presentations.

ICS reduce symptoms, increase lung function, improve quality of life, and reduce the risk of exacerbations and asthma-related hospitalizations or death. ICS differ in their potency and bioavailability, but most of the benefit is seen at low doses (see Box 8 (p14) for low, medium and high doses of different ICS). Most patients using ICS do not experience side-effects. Local side-effects include oropharyngeal candidiasis and dysphonia. Use of spacer with pMDI, and rinsing with water and spitting out after inhalation, reduce local side effects. High doses increase the risk of systemic side-effects. E R OR R EP R\n\nICS and long-acting beta2 agonist bronchodilator combinations (ICS/LABA) (pMDIs or DPIs) e.g. beclometasone/ formoterol, budesonide/formoterol, fluticasone furoate/ vilanterol, fluticasone propionate/formoterol, fluticasone propionate/ salmeterol, and mometasone/formoterol. When a medium dose of ICS alone fails to achieve good control of asthma, the addition of LABA to ICS improves symptoms, lung function and reduces exacerbations in more patients, more rapidly, than doubling the dose of ICS. Two regimens are available: maintenance ICS/LABA with SABA as reliever, and low-dose combination beclometasone or budesonide with formoterol for maintenance and reliever treatment. The LABA component may be associated with tachycardia, headache or cramps. Current recommendations are that LABA and ICS are safe for asthma when used in combination. Use of LABA without ICS in asthma is associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes. - D O NO T AL T\n\nLeukotriene modifiers (tablets) e.g. montelukast, pranlukast, zafirlukast, zileuton Target one part of the inflammatory pathway in asthma.

Inhaled SABAs are medications of choice for quick relief of asthma symptoms and bronchoconstriction including in acute exacerbations, and for pre-treatment of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. SABAs should be used only as-needed at the lowest dose and frequency required. Tremor and tachycardia are commonly reported with initial use of SABA, but tolerance to these effects usually develops rapidly. Excess use, or poor response indicate poor asthma control.

For recommendations regarding asthma in patients aged 1-18 years see <a href=\"http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/practitioner-professional-resources/bc-guidelines\">BCGuidelines.ca</a> - <i>Asthma in Children - Diagnosis and Management</i>.\n</p><p><b>Key Recommendations </b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>• 30% of asthma patients are misdiagnosed; send all patients for spirometry, where available, to confirm the diagnosis of asthma.\n</p><p>• Document the history of respiratory symptoms and objective evidence of airflow obstruction (i.e., spirometry) <b>in all</b> patients suspected of or with an asthma diagnosis, even in cases where the diagnosis seems certain.\n</p><p>• Do not prescribe asthma medications in cases of low clinical urgency and where patient has no documented objective evidence to support an asthma diagnosis. </p><p>• As many as 90%1 of asthma patients use their inhalers incorrectly; regularly review a patient's inhaler technique, especially when there is a poor or non-response to treatment. </p><p>• To improve inhaler technique, especially in those with poor coordination, prescribe all patients a spacer when taking their metered dose inhalers (MDI). </p><p>• To optimize self-management, consider sending all patients to an asthma education center, where available.\n</p><p>• Complete a written asthma action plan with all patients and reassess this plan with the patient on a regular basis, especially after an exacerbation.\n</p><p><b>Definition\n</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that is characterized by bronchial hyper-responsiveness and variable airflow obstruction. Asthma is a diverse disease that results in recurrent episodes, varying over time and in intensity, of one or more respiratory symptoms, such as wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness or coughing.\n</p><p><b>EPIDEMIOLOGY\n</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>The incidence of asthma in B.C. for patients between 5 and 54 years of age has remained constant since 2000/01, with an age standardized incidence rate for 2012/13 of 0.62%.2 This amounts to almost 16,000 new cases of asthma in B.C.2 The prevalence of asthma in B.C. has increased steadily since 2000/01 with an age standardized prevalence rate for 2012/13 of 10.53%, or an estimated 323,500 prevalent cases.2 </p><p>The hospital, Medical Services Plan and PharmaCare costs per asthma patient in 2012/13 was $539, $617 and $271/patient respectively.2 In 2012/13, the total health care costs for patients with an asthma diagnosis in B.C. was over $460 million.2\n</p><p>Although deaths and hospital admissions due to asthma have decreased over the past ten years over 50% of patients have asthma that is not well controlled.3 Asthma that is uncontrolled not only leads to increased health care costs it also results in productivity and work losses.3, 4\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><b>DIAGNOSIS\n</b></p><p>Due to the high prevalence of asthma, assess all patients for asthma who present with common asthma respiratory symptoms (see Figure 1). Take a history and perform a physical examination to determine if the pattern of respiratory symptoms supports the diagnosis of asthma (see Table 1. Adult clinical features to assess the probability of asthma). </p><p>A diagnosis of asthma is based on documenting a pattern of common asthma respiratory symptoms and objective evidence of variable airflow obstruction (see <i>Investigations or Tests</i>). </p><p>In patients with existing asthma diagnoses ensure there is documented evidence of variable airflow obstruction in their health care record. </p><p>•<b> Signs and Symptoms\n</b></p><p>Clinical features of asthma often are similar or overlap with other respiratory conditions, so ensure other possible diagnoses are ruled out before diagnosing a patient with asthma (see <i>Differential Diagnosis</i>). </p><p>In patients with existing asthma diagnoses and who respond poorly to treatment, assuming adherence, inhaler technique and co-morbidities are being treated, reconsider the diagnosis of asthma. </p><p><b>Table 1. Adult clinical features to assess the probability of asthma</b>5, 6\n</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><b>Clinical Features that...\n</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>Increase the Probability of Asthma </b></p></td><td><p><b>Lower the Probability of Asthma\n</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>• More than one of the common asthma respiratory symptoms (see <i>Figure 1</i><b>)</b>, particularly if symptoms are: </p><p>• worse at night or in the early morning\n</p><p>• in response to exercise, allergens, irritants (including work-related), viral infections and cold air\n</p><p>• varying over time and in intensity\n</p><p>• worse after taking aspirin or beta blockers\n</p><p>• History of atopic disorder\n</p><p>• Family history of atopic disorder and/or asthma\n</p><p>• Wheeze heard on auscultation\n</p><p>• Otherwise unexplained low forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) or peak expiratory flow (PEF)\n</p><p>• Childhood asthma diagnosis\n</p></td><td><p>• Prominent dizziness, light-headedness, peripheral tingling\n</p><p>• Chronic productive cough in the absence of wheeze or breathlessness\n</p><p>• Repeatedly normal physical examination of chest when symptomatic\n</p><p>• Voice disturbance\n</p><p>• Symptoms with colds only\n</p><p>• Significant smoking history (i.e., > 20 pack-years)\n</p><p>• Cardiac disease\n</p><p>• Normal PEF or spirometry when symptomatic\n</p><p>• No response to a trial of asthma therapy\n</p><p>• Clinical features pointing to alternative diagnosis\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><b>NOTE: 30% of patients with a physician diagnosis of asthma are misdiagnosed.</b>7-10<b> Thus, even in cases where the clinical diagnosis seems certain, it is still recommended that objective evidence of variable airflow obstruction be obtained.\n</b></p><p>•<b> Investigation or Tests\n</b></p><p><b>1. Spirometry </b></p><p>Spirometry (pre and post bronchodilator) is the preferred test for providing objective evidence of variable airflow obstruction. </p><p><b>NOTE: Negative spirometry results do not necessarily exclude the diagnosis of asthma. </b></p><p>If results are negative and clinical suspicion remains high, repeat spirometry on another occasion. Spirometry is more reliable when the patient is symptomatic. </p><p>The following result is typically considered objective evidence of variable airflow obstruction: </p><p>• A 12 % or greater improvement in FEV1 and > 200 ml from baseline 15 minutes after use of an inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA).9\n</p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Figure 1. Common asthma respiratory symptoms\n</b></p><p>• Wheeze\n</p><p>• Cough </p><p>• Shortness of breath (dyspnea)\n</p><p>• Chest tightness\n</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><b>2. Peak flow monitoring\n</b></p><p>Peak flow monitoring (PFM) may be useful in providing objective evidence of variable airflow obstruction when:\n</p><p>• Evidence is needed quickly and spirometry is unavailable (e.g., geography and access issues),\n</p><p>• In suspected cases of work-related asthma where PFM can be used at the workplace, and\n</p><p>• A patient is symptomatic and they have baseline peak flow readings for comparison (see <i>Associated Document - Asthma Action Plan</i>). </p><p>Spirometry is the preferred test as PFM can be unreliable for the following reasons: </p><p>• Reference values for peak flow readings are not as well standardized as spirometry, </p><p>• Readings are not always well documented by the patient,\n</p><p>• Readings are more variable than spirometry, and\n</p><p>• Device may malfunction.\n</p><p><b>NOTE</b>: Ensure the same meter is used for PFM as readings can vary substantially by device. </p><p>The following result is typically considered objective evidence of variable airflow obstruction: </p><p>• A > 20% change after administration of a bronchodilator; a 20% change in values over time.11 </p><p><b>3. Methacholine challenge\n</b></p><p>When spirometry and PFM results are negative and clinical suspicion remains, a methacholine challenge can be used to assess airway hyper-responsiveness. A positive result is diagnostic of asthma; however, false negatives may occur when the patient: </p><p>• has seasonal asthma, and/or\n</p><p>• is well controlled on pharmacological treatment, and/or\n</p><p>• is currently asymptomatic.\n</p><p><b>4. Trial of pharmaceutical therapy\n</b></p><p>It is <b>not recommended</b> to use a trial of pharmaceutical therapy as evidence to support the asthma diagnosis. </p><p>In cases of low clinical urgency and timely access to spirometry consider delaying the initiation of pharmaceutical therapy until objective evidence of variable airflow obstruction can be obtained. </p><p><b>NOTE:</b> once pharmaceutical therapy begins it is harder to obtain objective evidence to support the asthma diagnosis. </p><p><b>5. Chest x-ray\n</b></p><p>Chest x-rays are not routinely required but may be useful for excluding other diagnoses. </p><p><b>6. Allergy testing\n</b></p><p>For patients whose symptoms are not well controlled, it may be helpful to identify allergens the patient is sensitive to. Inhalant allergen exposures have been shown to lead to asthma attacks in some patients. Food allergens are not a common producer of asthma symptoms.5 (See <i>Appendix A: Lifestyle and Environmental Modifications</i>).\n</p><p>•<b> Differential Diagnosis\n</b></p><p>In cases of diagnostic uncertainty and/or there is no response to treatment consider the differential diagnosis. The following are the most common* alternative diagnoses to consider:\n</p><p><b>1. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)\n</b></p><p>If clinical features of patient suggest COPD (e.g., patient is a current or past smoker), see <a href=\"http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/health/practitioner-professional-resources/bc-guidelines\">BCGuidelines.ca</a><b> - </b><i>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)</i> and/or refer to specialist.\n</p><p><b>2. Asthma-COPD Overlap Syndrome (ACOS)\n</b></p><p>In patients that are older and who are smokers it may be hard to distinguish if the patient has asthma or COPD, and in some cases the patient may have ACOS. ACOS is characterized by airflow limitation and is identified by the symptoms it shares with both asthma and COPD. For more information see Global Initiative for Asthma's Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention Chapter 5: Diagnosis of asthma, COPD, and asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS), website: <a href=\"http://www.ginasthma.org\">www.ginasthma.org</a>. </p><p><b>3. Work-related Asthma\n</b></p><p>Work-related asthma includes both occupational asthma (asthma symptoms that are a result of exposure to workplace irritant/allergen) and work-aggravated asthma (pre-existing asthma symptoms that worsen due to exposure of workplace irritant/allergen).12 Work-related asthma accounts for approximately 5-20%13 of new adult onset asthma cases and at least 15%14 of all adult asthma cases; thus, resulting in a significant socioeconomic loss to society. Ask all patients about potential occupational exposures at the workplace.5 For more information see <i>Appendix A</i> Table 1. Examples of occupational exposures that can contribute to asthma. </p><p>Refer all patients with suspected work-related asthma to a specialist.\n</p><p><b>MANAGEMENT\n</b></p><p>•<b> Treatment\n</b></p><p>• Asthma is predominantly treated using pharmaceutical therapy recommended through a stepwise approach (see <i>Pharmacological Management - Stepwise Approach</i>). The stepwise approach bases a patient's treatment on their current corresponding level of asthma control (see <i>Assessment of Asthma Control </i>below). </p><p>• Identify asthma triggers and recommend relevant lifestyle and environmental modifications to support the treatment plan (see <i>Appendix A</i>).\n</p><p>• Complete a personalized written asthma action plan with the patient so they know how to self-manage worsening asthma symptoms and when to seek medical help (see <i>Self-Management</i> and <i>Asthma Action Plan</i>).\n</p><p>•<b> Assessment of Asthma Control\n</b></p><p>Assess asthma control at the time of diagnosis, when creating/modifying a treatment plan and when monitoring treatment outcomes. Consider both symptom control and risk of a future asthma attack. </p><p>* To consider less common alternative diagnoses refer to the Global Initiative for Asthma's <i>Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention</i>, available at: <a href=\"http://www.ginasthma.org\">www.ginasthma.org</a> or refer patient to a specialist. </p><p><b>1.

See <a href=\"http://www.astrazeneca.ca\">product monograph</a> for more information on treatment considerations.\n</p><p>•<b> Self-Management\n</b></p><p>Successful self-management education for patients includes the following:\n</p><p>1. Discussing with the patient:\n</p><p>• the condition (e.g., asthma is a chronic condition, how asthma attacks occur),\n</p><p>• the goals of treatment (e.g., what well controlled asthma look like, patient's concept of quality of life), and </p><p>• the treatment options (e.g., patient's willingness to modify lifestyle/environment based on trigger identification and to use pharmacological therapy). There is minimal evidence supporting the greater efficacy of dry powder inhalers over metered dose inhalers and spacers in adult patients.20 Choose inhaler based on the patient's preference (e.g., cost, willingness to use the prescribed device, and ability to adhere to treatment plan). See <i>Appendix A</i> and <i>Appendix C: Asthma Medication Table</i> for more information.\n</p><p>2. Developing a written asthma action plan with the patient (see <i>Asthma Action Plan</i>).\n</p><p>3. Referring patient to an asthma education program, where available. See <i>Physician and Patient Resources</i>.\n</p><p>4. Reviewing the following with the patient at regular office visits† (see <i>Associated Document - Asthma Patient Care Flow Sheet for Adults</i>): </p><p>• medication adherence (e.g., is patient taking their medication as prescribed?) see Figure 2,\n</p><p>• inhaler technique (e.g., have patient demonstrate how they take their inhalers),\n</p><p>• level of symptom control and ability to follow lifestyle modifications,\n</p><p>• how to monitor symptoms and in patients with poor perception of their symptoms how to monitor peak flow,21 and\n</p><p>• Asthma action plan (modify if necessary).\n</p><p>•<b> Treating acute loss of asthma control</b><b>5\n</b></p><p><b>1.

See<i> Asthma Action Plan</i>. </p><p>• Monitor patient closely and continue treatment until peak flow readings improve > 60-80% of patient's best.\n</p><p>• Give OCS to patients who are not responding to SABA, deteriorating or who have increased their inhaler doses before presenting. (OCS adult dose 1mg/kg/day, max 50mg/day for 5-7 days). </p><p>• If patient improves: review <i>Asthma Action Plan</i> (make modifications as necessary), review how to monitor symptoms, review inhaler technique and adherence, what to do if symptoms worsen and schedule follow-up appointment (1 week later) if patient stabilizes. </p><p>• Increase controller medications for the next 2-4 weeks‡ and prescribe controllers for patients who are not taking them already.\n</p><p>• If patient gets worse and is admitted to hospital: depending on the clinical context, schedule follow-up appointment for 2-7 days after the asthma attack. See <i>Self-Management</i>.\n</p><p>• <b>If there is no response to treatment or patient continues to deteriorate arrange urgent transfer to acute care facility.\n</b></p><p>•<b> Management of poor or incomplete response to long-term treatment\n</b></p><p>If there is a poor or non-response to proposed treatment plan, consider the following: 1. Poor adherence with medications due to:\n</p><p>• cost of prescribed medications is a significant barrier. Ensure patient can afford the medication prescribed. Discuss patient's drug plan to ensure appropriate coverage. See <i>Appendix C - Asthma Medication Table\n</i></p><p>• inhaler burden - try to prescribe less inhalers if possible (e.g., combination devices versus several individual inhalers that do the same thing)\n</p><p>2. Incorrect inhaler technique - prescribe spacer and review its use.20\n</p><p>3. Review and readdress risk factors and co-morbidities (e.g., smoking, triggers, rhinosinusitis, obesity and gastro-esophageal reflux disease). </p><p>4.

Daily maximum is 8 inhalations. Do not use if patient symptoms are controlled on low/med-dose ICS. See <a href=\"http://www.astrazeneca.ca\">product monograph</a> for more information on treatment considerations.\n</p><p><b>Further considerations for choosing steps:\n</b></p><p><b>Step 1.</b> SABA as needed (PRN) alone: If forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is normal, symptoms are controlled and no risk factors for future asthma attacks (see <i>Assessment of Asthma Control</i>).\n</p><p><b>NOTE:</b> chronic airway inflammation can be found in these patients and the safety of SABA-alone asthma treatment is not well known.1\n</p><p><b>Step 2.</b> Regular low-dose ICS (plus SABA PRN) is recommended in patients with:\n</p><p>• Asthma symptoms more than twice a month\n</p><p>• Waking due to asthma more than once a month\n</p><p>• Asthma symptoms plus any risk factor(s) for exacerbations (see <i>Assessment of Asthma Control</i>)\n</p><p>• Seasonal allergic asthma - initiate when symptoms begin and discontinue 4 weeks after last seasonal exposure.2 </p><p>Treatment with a regular daily low-dose ICS is highly effective in reducing asthma symptoms, the risk of asthma-related exacerbations, hospitalization and death. Leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) is a less effective alternate; ICS/LABA is a more expensive alternate.\n</p><p><b>Step 3.</b> Med-dose ICS (plus SABA PRN) or low-dose ICS/LABA (plus SABA PRN) or low-dose Symbicort MART. Add-on with LABA may reduce exacerbations requiring oral steroids by 1% (ARR)3 compared with med/high-dose ICS (NNT=73-100).3 Consider cost and inhaler burden compliance concerns. Step 3 is recommended in patients with troublesome asthma symptoms on most days, greater than one awakening from asthma symptoms per week, and especially if risk factors for exacerbations exist. </p><p><b>Step 4.</b> Med-dose ICS/LABA or low/med-dose Symbicort MART. The considerations to move to step 4 are similar to moving from step 2 to step 3. Consider low-dose Symbicort MART only when low/med does ICS is ineffective and there are adherence concerns (e.g., inhaler burden). High-dose ICS has more side-effects and little added benefit as the dose-response curve to ICS is flat after initiation of low dose ICS.\n</p><p><b>Step 5.</b> Obtain specialist guidance.\n</p><p><b>Considerations for stepping down:</b>§\n</p><p><b>Step 5 </b>•<b> Step 4.</b> Obtain specialist guidance. </p><p><b>Step 4 </b>•<b> Step 3.</b> </p><p>• If on med/high-dose ICS/LABA • IReduce ICS component by 50%; do not D/C LABA; continue SABA PRN. </p><p>• If on med-dose Symbicort MART •Reduce to low-dose Symbicort MART.4 </p><p>• If on high-dose ICS •<b> </b>Reduce ICS dose by 50%; continue SABA PRN.5 </p><p><b>Step 3 </b>•<b> Step 2.\n</b></p><p>• If on low-dose ICS/LABA • Reduce to once daily; D/C LABA likely to lead to deterioration; continue SABA PRN.\n</p><p>• If on low-dose Symbicort MART • Reduce maintenance component to once a day and continue low-dose reliever PRN.4 </p><p>• If on med-dose ICS • Reduce ICS dose by 50%; continue SABA PRN.\n</p><p><b>Step 2 </b>•<b> Step 1.\n</b></p><p>• If on low-dose ICS • Once daily dosing (budesonide, ciclesonide, mometasone, fluticasone). </p><p>• Consider stopping treatment if no symptoms for 6-12 months and no risk factors - monitor closely as asthma attack risk increases when ICS is stopped.\n</p><p><b>References:\n</b></p><p>1 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA).

For recommendations regarding asthma in patients aged 1-18 years see BCGuidelines.ca - Asthma in Children - Diagnosis and Management. Key Recommendations\n\n• 30% of asthma patients are misdiagnosed; send all patients for spirometry, where available, to confirm the diagnosis of asthma. • Document the history of respiratory symptoms and objective evidence of airflow obstruction (i.e., spirometry) in all patients suspected of or with an asthma diagnosis, even in cases where the diagnosis seems certain. • Do not prescribe asthma medications in cases of low clinical urgency and where patient has no documented objective evidence to support an asthma diagnosis. • As many as 90%1 of asthma patients use their inhalers incorrectly; regularly review a patient's inhaler technique, especially when there is a poor or non-response to treatment. • To improve inhaler technique, especially in those with poor coordination, prescribe all patients a spacer when taking their metered dose inhalers (MDI). • To optimize self-management, consider sending all patients to an asthma education center, where available. • Complete a written asthma action plan with all patients and reassess this plan with the patient on a regular basis, especially after an exacerbation. Definition\n\nAsthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that is characterized by bronchial hyper-responsiveness and variable airflow obstruction. Asthma is a diverse disease that results in recurrent episodes, varying over time and in intensity, of one or more respiratory symptoms, such as wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness or coughing. EPIDEMIOLOGY\n\nThe incidence of asthma in B.C. for patients between 5 and 54 years of age has remained constant since 2000/01, with an age standardized incidence rate for 2012/13 of 0.62%.2 This amounts to almost 16,000 new cases of asthma in B.C.2 The prevalence of asthma in B.C. has increased steadily since 2000/01 with an age standardized prevalence rate for 2012/13 of 10.53%, or an estimated 323,500 prevalent cases.2 The hospital, Medical Services Plan and PharmaCare costs per asthma patient in 2012/13 was $539, $617 and $271/patient respectively.2 In 2012/13, the total health care costs for patients with an asthma diagnosis in B.C. was over $460 million.2 Although deaths and hospital admissions due to asthma have decreased over the past ten years over 50% of patients have asthma that is not well controlled.3 Asthma that is uncontrolled not only leads to increased health care costs it also results in productivity and work losses.3, 4\n\nDIAGNOSIS\n\nDue to the high prevalence of asthma, assess all patients for asthma who present with common asthma respiratory symptoms (see Figure 1). Take a history and perform a physical examination to determine if the pattern of respiratory symptoms supports the diagnosis of asthma (see Table 1. Adult clinical features to assess the probability of asthma).\n\nA diagnosis of asthma is based on documenting a pattern of common asthma respiratory symptoms and objective evidence of variable airflow obstruction (see Investigations or Tests).\n\nIn patients with existing asthma diagnoses ensure there is documented evidence of variable airflow obstruction in their health care record.\n\n• Signs and Symptoms\n\nClinical features of asthma often are similar or overlap with other respiratory conditions, so ensure other possible diagnoses are ruled out before diagnosing a patient with asthma (see Differential Diagnosis).\n\nIn patients with existing asthma diagnoses and who respond poorly to treatment, assuming adherence, inhaler technique and co-morbidities are being treated, reconsider the diagnosis of asthma.\n\nTable 1. Adult clinical features to assess the probability of asthma5, 6\n\nClinical Features that...\n\nIncrease the Probability of Asthma Lower the Probability of Asthma\n\n• More than one of the common asthma respiratory symptoms (see Figure 1), particularly if symptoms are: • worse at night or in the early morning • in response to exercise, allergens, irritants (including work-related), viral infections and cold air • varying over time and in intensity • worse after taking aspirin or beta blockers • History of atopic disorder • Family history of atopic disorder and/or asthma • Wheeze heard on auscultation • Otherwise unexplained low forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) or peak expiratory flow (PEF) • Childhood asthma diagnosis • Prominent dizziness, light-headedness, peripheral tingling • Chronic productive cough in the absence of wheeze or breathlessness • Repeatedly normal physical examination of chest when symptomatic • Voice disturbance • Symptoms with colds only • Significant smoking history (i.e., > 20 pack-years) • Cardiac disease • Normal PEF or spirometry when symptomatic • No response to a trial of asthma therapy • Clinical features pointing to alternative diagnosis\n\nNOTE: 30% of patients with a physician diagnosis of asthma are misdiagnosed.7-10 Thus, even in cases where the clinical diagnosis seems certain, it is still recommended that objective evidence of variable airflow obstruction be obtained.\n\n• Investigation or Tests\n\n1. Spirometry\n\nSpirometry (pre and post bronchodilator) is the preferred test for providing objective evidence of variable airflow obstruction.\n\nNOTE: Negative spirometry results do not necessarily exclude the diagnosis of asthma.\n\nIf results are negative and clinical suspicion remains high, repeat spirometry on another occasion. Spirometry is more reliable when the patient is symptomatic.\n\nThe following result is typically considered objective evidence of variable airflow obstruction:\n\n• A 12 % or greater improvement in FEV1 and > 200 ml from baseline 15 minutes after use of an inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA).9\n\nFigure 1. Common asthma respiratory symptoms • Wheeze • Cough • Shortness of breath (dyspnea) • Chest tightness\n\n2. Peak flow monitoring\n\nPeak flow monitoring (PFM) may be useful in providing objective evidence of variable airflow obstruction when:\n\n• Evidence is needed quickly and spirometry is unavailable (e.g., geography and access issues),\n\n• In suspected cases of work-related asthma where PFM can be used at the workplace, and\n\n• A patient is symptomatic and they have baseline peak flow readings for comparison (see Associated Document - Asthma Action Plan).\n\nSpirometry is the preferred test as PFM can be unreliable for the following reasons:\n\n• Reference values for peak flow readings are not as well standardized as spirometry,\n\n• Readings are not always well documented by the patient,\n\n• Readings are more variable than spirometry, and\n\n• Device may malfunction.\n\nNOTE: Ensure the same meter is used for PFM as readings can vary substantially by device.\n\nThe following result is typically considered objective evidence of variable airflow obstruction:\n\n• A > 20% change after administration of a bronchodilator; a 20% change in values over time.11\n\n3. Methacholine challenge\n\nWhen spirometry and PFM results are negative and clinical suspicion remains, a methacholine challenge can be used to assess airway hyper-responsiveness. A positive result is diagnostic of asthma; however, false negatives may occur when the patient:\n\n• has seasonal asthma, and/or\n\n• is well controlled on pharmacological treatment, and/or\n\n• is currently asymptomatic.\n\n4. Trial of pharmaceutical therapy\n\nIt is not recommended to use a trial of pharmaceutical therapy as evidence to support the asthma diagnosis.\n\nIn cases of low clinical urgency and timely access to spirometry consider delaying the initiation of pharmaceutical therapy until objective evidence of variable airflow obstruction can be obtained.\n\nNOTE: once pharmaceutical therapy begins it is harder to obtain objective evidence to support the asthma diagnosis.\n\n5. Chest x-ray\n\nChest x-rays are not routinely required but may be useful for excluding other diagnoses.\n\n6. Allergy testing\n\nFor patients whose symptoms are not well controlled, it may be helpful to identify allergens the patient is sensitive to. Inhalant allergen exposures have been shown to lead to asthma attacks in some patients. Food allergens are not a common producer of asthma symptoms.5 (See Appendix A: Lifestyle and Environmental Modifications).\n\n• Differential Diagnosis\n\nIn cases of diagnostic uncertainty and/or there is no response to treatment consider the differential diagnosis. The following are the most common* alternative diagnoses to consider:\n\n1. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)\n\nIf clinical features of patient suggest COPD (e.g., patient is a current or past smoker), see BCGuidelines.ca - Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and/or refer to specialist.\n\n2. Asthma-COPD Overlap Syndrome (ACOS)\n\nIn patients that are older and who are smokers it may be hard to distinguish if the patient has asthma or COPD, and in some cases the patient may have ACOS. ACOS is characterized by airflow limitation and is identified by the symptoms it shares with both asthma and COPD. For more information see Global Initiative for Asthma's Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention Chapter 5: Diagnosis of asthma, COPD, and asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS), website: www.ginasthma.org.\n\n3. Work-related Asthma\n\nWork-related asthma includes both occupational asthma (asthma symptoms that are a result of exposure to workplace irritant/allergen) and work-aggravated asthma (pre-existing asthma symptoms that worsen due to exposure of workplace irritant/allergen).12 Work-related asthma accounts for approximately 5-20%13 of new adult onset asthma cases and at least 15%14 of all adult asthma cases; thus, resulting in a significant socioeconomic loss to society. Ask all patients about potential occupational exposures at the workplace.5 For more information see Appendix A Table 1. Examples of occupational exposures that can contribute to asthma.\n\nRefer all patients with suspected work-related asthma to a specialist.\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\n• Treatment\n\n• Asthma is predominantly treated using pharmaceutical therapy recommended through a stepwise approach (see Pharmacological Management - Stepwise Approach). The stepwise approach bases a patient's treatment on their current corresponding level of asthma control (see Assessment of Asthma Control below).\n\n• Identify asthma triggers and recommend relevant lifestyle and environmental modifications to support the treatment plan (see Appendix A).\n\n• Complete a personalized written asthma action plan with the patient so they know how to self-manage worsening asthma symptoms and when to seek medical help (see Self-Management and Asthma Action Plan).\n\n• Assessment of Asthma Control\n\nAssess asthma control at the time of diagnosis, when creating/modifying a treatment plan and when monitoring treatment outcomes. Consider both symptom control and risk of a future asthma attack.\n\n* To consider less common alternative diagnoses refer to the Global Initiative for Asthma's Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention, available at: www.ginasthma.org or refer patient to a specialist.\n\n1. Asthma Symptom Control15, 16\n\nIn the past 4 weeks, has the patient had: Yes [1 point] No [0 points]\n\nDaytime asthma symptoms more than twice/week?\n\nAny night waking due to asthma?\n\nReliever needed for symptoms* more than twice/week?\n\nAny activity limitation due to asthma?\n\nFEV1 or peak flow < 80% of personal best?\n\nTOTAL POINTS\n\n* Excludes reliever taken before exercise if patient is well and has no other asthma symptoms.\n\n0 points = well controlled asthma symptoms 1-2 points = partly controlled asthma symptoms ≥ 3 points = uncontrolled asthma symptoms\n\n2. Risk of a Future Asthma Attack8, 15, 17-19\n\nDoes the patient have any of the following risk factors:\n\n• ≥ 1 severe attack (e.g., requires hospitalization, oral steroid use) in last 12 months\n\n• Uncontrolled asthma symptoms\n\n• Co-morbidities: obesity, rhinosinusitis, confirmed food allergy\n\n• Ever intubated or in intensive care unit for asthma\n\n• Excessive SABA use (> 1 x 200-dose canister/month)\n\n• Exposure to tobacco smoke\n\n• Inadequate inhaled corticosteroid (ICS): not prescribed ICS; poor adherence; incorrect inhaler technique\n\n• Low FEV1, especially if <60% predicted\n\n• Major psychological or socioeconomic problems (e.g., depression in older adults)\n\n• Sputum or blood eosinophilia\n\n• Pregnancy\n\nIf the patient has any of these risk factors they are at risk for future asthma attacks. Consider strategies to eliminate modifiable risk factors (e.g., tobacco cessation programs, weight loss programs, etc.).\n\n• Pharmacological Management - Stepwise Approach\n\nRefer to Table 2. Initiating inhalers - stepwise approach to treatment.\n\nInitial Treatment:\n\n• Choose step based on assessment of asthma control (symptom control and risk of future asthma attacks) and patient's preference (e.g., cost, willingness to use the prescribed device, and ability to adhere to treatment plan).\n\n• Aim to have the patient at the lowest step needed for asthma control.\n\nStep up:\n\n• Consider if symptoms not routinely controlled or if patient continues to have recurrent asthma attacks at current step.\n\n• Before stepping up, confirm the diagnosis, review patient's self-management education and lifestyle/environmental modifications and ensure medication adherence and correct inhaler technique.\n\nStep down:\n\n• Consider stepping down if symptoms are controlled for ≥ 3 months and risk of asthma attack is low.\n\nTable 2. Initiating inhalers - stepwise approach to treatment\n\nPREFERRED CONTROLLER STEP 1 STEP 2 STEP 3 STEP 4 STEP 5\n\nMay not need controller Low-dose ICS Med-dose ICS Low-dose ICS/long- acting beta-2 agonist (LABA) Low-dose Symbicort Maintenance and Reliever Therapy (MART)* Med-dose ICS/LABA Low-dose Symbicort (MART)* Refer patients with persistent symptoms, exacerbations despite adherence, good inhaler technique and step 4 treatments\n\nAlternate options Low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) High-dose ICS (more side -effects, limited benefit, dose-response curve flattens. Trial for 3-6months)\n\nRELIEVER As needed short-acting beta-2 agonists (SABA) As needed SABA or Symbicort (MART)*\n\n*Symbicort Maintenance And Reliever Therapy (MART) is the use of Symbicort as both regular maintenance treatment (usually BID) and as a reliever when asthma symptoms are present (1 inhalation, repeat as needed every 5 minutes to a max of 6 inhalations). Daily maximum is 8 inhalations. Do not use if patient symptoms are controlled on low/med-dose ICS. See product monograph for more information on treatment considerations.\n\n• Self-Management\n\nSuccessful self-management education for patients includes the following:\n\n1. Discussing with the patient:\n\n• the condition (e.g., asthma is a chronic condition, how asthma attacks occur),\n\n• the goals of treatment (e.g., what well controlled asthma look like, patient's concept of quality of life), and\n\n• the treatment options (e.g., patient's willingness to modify lifestyle/environment based on trigger identification and to use pharmacological therapy). There is minimal evidence supporting the greater efficacy of dry powder inhalers over metered dose inhalers and spacers in adult patients.20 Choose inhaler based on the patient's preference (e.g., cost, willingness to use the prescribed device, and ability to adhere to treatment plan). See Appendix A and Appendix C: Asthma Medication Table for more information.\n\n2. Developing a written asthma action plan with the patient (see Asthma Action Plan).\n\n3. Referring patient to an asthma education program, where available. See Physician and Patient Resources.\n\n4. Reviewing the following with the patient at regular office visits† (see Associated Document - Asthma Patient Care Flow Sheet for Adults):\n\n• medication adherence (e.g., is patient taking their medication as prescribed?) see Figure 2,\n\n• inhaler technique (e.g., have patient demonstrate how they take their inhalers),\n\n• level of symptom control and ability to follow lifestyle modifications,\n\n• how to monitor symptoms and in patients with poor perception of their symptoms how to monitor peak flow,21 and\n\n• Asthma action plan (modify if necessary).\n\n• Treating acute loss of asthma control5\n\n1. Assess the severity of the asthma attack:\n\n• Severe - life-threatening: While arranging urgent transfer to an acute care facility treat the patient with short-acting beta2-agonists (SABA), controlled oxygen and oral corticosteroids (OCS).\n\n• Mild-moderate: treat in the primary care setting (see Goals of treatment and Treatment steps below).\n\n† Visits also include follow-up visits after a patient has had an asthma attack.\n\nFigure 2. Key messages to improve inhaled corticosteroid use • Are safe and do not create dependency • Meant for regular use rather than intermittent • Smoking and exposure to second hand smoke reduces efficacy.\n\n2. Goals of treatment:\n\n• Rapidly relieve airflow obstruction,\n\n• Identify and address the cause of the asthma attack, and\n\n• Reduce risk of relapse by reviewing and adjusting maintenance treatment plan.\n\n3. Treatment steps:\n\n• Administer SABA with a spacer 2-6 puffs every 20 min for first hour then decrease frequency based on patient response.\n\n• A good response to SABA is PEF > 80% of personal best, 50-79% is an incomplete response (administer OCS), and <50% PEF is a need for urgent medical care. See Asthma Action Plan.\n\n• Monitor patient closely and continue treatment until peak flow readings improve > 60-80% of patient's best.\n\n• Give OCS to patients who are not responding to SABA, deteriorating or who have increased their inhaler doses before presenting. (OCS adult dose 1mg/kg/day, max 50mg/day for 5-7 days).\n\n• If patient improves: review Asthma Action Plan (make modifications as necessary), review how to monitor symptoms, review inhaler technique and adherence, what to do if symptoms worsen and schedule follow-up appointment (1 week later) if patient stabilizes.\n\n• Increase controller medications for the next 2-4 weeks‡ and prescribe controllers for patients who are not taking them already.\n\n• If patient gets worse and is admitted to hospital: depending on the clinical context, schedule follow-up appointment for 2-7 days after the asthma attack. See Self-Management.\n\n• If there is no response to treatment or patient continues to deteriorate arrange urgent transfer to acute care facility.\n\n• Management of poor or incomplete response to long-term treatment\n\nIf there is a poor or non-response to proposed treatment plan, consider the following: 1. Poor adherence with medications due to:\n\n• cost of prescribed medications is a significant barrier. Ensure patient can afford the medication prescribed. Discuss patient's drug plan to ensure appropriate coverage. See Appendix C - Asthma Medication Table\n\n• inhaler burden - try to prescribe less inhalers if possible (e.g., combination devices versus several individual inhalers that do the same thing)\n\n2. Incorrect inhaler technique - prescribe spacer and review its use.20\n\n3. Review and readdress risk factors and co-morbidities (e.g., smoking, triggers, rhinosinusitis, obesity and gastro-esophageal reflux disease).\n\n4. Confirm and review diagnosis and refer to specialist for further investigation.\n\n‡ For more information on dose recommendations see page 61 of Global Initiative for Asthma's Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention (2014). www.ginasthma.org\n\nRESOURCES\n\n• References\n\n1.

The Guidelines are intended to give an understanding of a clinical problem, and outline one or more preferred approaches to the investigation and management of the problem. The Guidelines are not intended as a substitute for the advice or professional judgment of a health care professional, nor are they intended to be the only approach to the management of clinical problem. We cannot respond to patients or patient advocates requesting advice on issues related to medical conditions. If you need medical advice, please contact a health care professional.\n\nAppendix A: Lifestyle and Environmental Modifications\n\nConsider the following triggers and mitigation strategies when developing a patient's treatment plan:\n\nAllergens\n\n• Year-long: consider common home allergens (e.g., pets, mold, dust mites), refer to allergist for testing and management - remove allergen(s) if possible.\n\n• Seasonal: consider seasonal outdoor allergens (e.g., grass, trees, weeds), refer to allergist for testing and management - minimize exposure to allergen/ allergy shots.\n\nFood/Sulfites\n\n• Symptoms after eating shrimp and/or drinking beer or wine - consider sulfite allergies - allergen avoidance\n\nWork\n\n• Consider occupational allergens (see Table 1. Examples of occupational exposures that can contribute to asthma) - consider workplace adjustments/change.\n\nExercise\n\n• Encourage exercise and SABA PRN pre exercise to reduce exercise induced symptoms.\n\nMedication\n\n• Symptoms after taking medication - consider common medications (e.g., beta-blockers including ophthalmic preparations, ASA, NSAIDs, and ACE-Inhibitors) - stop medication and prescribe an alternative.\n\nTobacco smoke\n\n• Identify first, second and third hand smoke sources - remove from living areas if possible.\n\n• If patient smokes discuss their willingness to quit (discuss at every visit until patient is willing to try quitting smoking) - provide resources to patients who want to quit smoking, see Physician and Patient Resources.\n\nIrritants\n\n• Consider other irritants, such as wood-burning stove/fireplace, fragrances, cleaners, painting, air pollution - remove/avoid allergens.\n\nVaccinations\n\n• Recommend annual influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations for all patients with asthma.\n\nTable 1. Examples of occupational exposures that can contribute to asthma\n\nJobs at risk Possible causative agent\n\nCar paint spraying Isocyanates\n\nLaboratory work Small animals\n\nJoinery Hard woods\n\nElectronics, soldering Colophony\n\nBakery, farming Grain, flour improver\n\nHealthcare workers Glutaraldehyde\n\nHeavy manual work Exercise\n\nFarming Mouldy hay\n\nSource: Table adapted from Chambers R, Moore S, Parker G, et al.

(Chapter: The relationship between work and health).\n\nAppendix B: Initiating Inhalers - A Stepwise Approach to Treatment\n\nRefer to Table 1. Initiating inhalers - stepwise approach to treatment.\n\nInitial Treatment:\n\n• Choose step based on assessment of asthma control (symptom control and risk of future asthma attacks) and patient's preference (e.g., cost, willingness to use the prescribed device, and ability to adhere to treatment plan).\n\n• Aim to have the patient at the lowest step needed for asthma control.\n\nStep up:\n\n• Consider if symptoms not routinely controlled or if patient continues to have recurrent asthma attacks at current step.\n\n• Before stepping up, confirm the diagnosis, review patient's self-management education and lifestyle/environmental modifications and ensure medication adherence and correct inhaler technique.\n\nStep down:\n\n• Consider stepping down if symptoms are controlled for ≥ 3 months and risk of asthma attack is low.\n\nTable 1. Initiating inhalers - stepwise approach to treatment\n\nPREFERRED CONTROLLER STEP 1 STEP 2 STEP 3 STEP 4 STEP 5\n\nMay not need controller Low-dose ICS Med-dose ICS Low-dose ICS/long- acting beta-2 agonist (LABA) Low-dose Symbicort Maintenance and Reliever Therapy (MART)* Med-dose ICS/LABA Low-dose Symbicort (MART)* Refer patients with persistent symptoms, exacerbations despite adherence, good inhaler technique and step 4 treatments\n\nAlternate options Low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) High-dose ICS (more side -effects, limited benefit, dose-response curve flattens. Trial for 3-6months)\n\nRELIEVER As needed short-acting beta-2 agonists (SABA) As needed SABA or Symbicort (MART)*\n\n* Symbicort Maintenance And Reliever Therapy (MART) is the use of Symbicort as both regular maintenance treatment (usually BID) and as a reliever when asthma symptoms are present (1 inhalation, repeat as needed every 5 minutes to a max of 6 inhalations). Daily maximum is 8 inhalations. Do not use if patient symptoms are controlled on low/med-dose ICS. See product monograph for more information on treatment considerations.\n\nFurther considerations for choosing steps:\n\nStep 1. SABA as needed (PRN) alone: If forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) is normal, symptoms are controlled and no risk factors for future asthma attacks (see Assessment of Asthma Control).\n\nNOTE: chronic airway inflammation can be found in these patients and the safety of SABA-alone asthma treatment is not well known.1\n\nStep 2. Regular low-dose ICS (plus SABA PRN) is recommended in patients with:\n\n• Asthma symptoms more than twice a month\n\n• Waking due to asthma more than once a month\n\n• Asthma symptoms plus any risk factor(s) for exacerbations (see Assessment of Asthma Control)\n\n• Seasonal allergic asthma - initiate when symptoms begin and discontinue 4 weeks after last seasonal exposure.2\n\nTreatment with a regular daily low-dose ICS is highly effective in reducing asthma symptoms, the risk of asthma-related exacerbations, hospitalization and death. Leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) is a less effective alternate; ICS/LABA is a more expensive alternate.\n\nStep 3. Med-dose ICS (plus SABA PRN) or low-dose ICS/LABA (plus SABA PRN) or low-dose Symbicort MART. Add-on with LABA may reduce exacerbations requiring oral steroids by 1% (ARR)3 compared with med/high-dose ICS (NNT=73-100).3 Consider cost and inhaler burden compliance concerns. Step 3 is recommended in patients with troublesome asthma symptoms on most days, greater than one awakening from asthma symptoms per week, and especially if risk factors for exacerbations exist.\n\nStep 4. Med-dose ICS/LABA or low/med-dose Symbicort MART. The considerations to move to step 4 are similar to moving from step 2 to step 3. Consider low-dose Symbicort MART only when low/med does ICS is ineffective and there are adherence concerns (e.g., inhaler burden). High-dose ICS has more side-effects and little added benefit as the dose-response curve to ICS is flat after initiation of low dose ICS.\n\nStep 5. Obtain specialist guidance.\n\nConsiderations for stepping down:§\n\nStep 5 • Step 4. Obtain specialist guidance.\n\nStep 4 • Step 3.\n\n• If on med/high-dose ICS/LABA • IReduce ICS component by 50%; do not D/C LABA; continue SABA PRN.\n\n• If on med-dose Symbicort MART •Reduce to low-dose Symbicort MART.4\n\n• If on high-dose ICS • Reduce ICS dose by 50%; continue SABA PRN.5\n\nStep 3 • Step 2.\n\n• If on low-dose ICS/LABA • Reduce to once daily; D/C LABA likely to lead to deterioration; continue SABA PRN.\n\n• If on low-dose Symbicort MART • Reduce maintenance component to once a day and continue low-dose reliever PRN.4\n\n• If on med-dose ICS • Reduce ICS dose by 50%; continue SABA PRN.\n\nStep 2 • Step 1.\n\n• If on low-dose ICS • Once daily dosing (budesonide, ciclesonide, mometasone, fluticasone).\n\n• Consider stopping treatment if no symptoms for 6-12 months and no risk factors - monitor closely as asthma attack risk increases when ICS is stopped.\n\nReferences:\n\n1 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA).

The statement includes a summary of the available literature, as well as evidence-based recommendations for patient management, developed by a multidisciplinary group composed of pulmonary, critical care, general internal medicine, and infectious disease specialists. The sections of this document are as follows: an overview of the purpose of our efforts and the methodology used to collect and grade the available data; a review of the likely etiologic pathogens causing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), including a discussion of drug-resistant <i> </i></p><p><i>Streptococcus pneumoniae\n</i> </p><p>(DRSP); a proposed approach to patient stratification for the purpose of predicting the likely etiologic pathogens of different patient populations with CAP; a summary of available and recommended diagnostic studies; suggestions on how to define the need for hospitalization and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for patients with CAP; guidelines for antibiotic therapy of CAP, including principles of therapy and specific recommendations for each patient category; an approach to the nonre-sponding patient, as well as a discussion of when to switch to oral therapy and when to discharge an admitted patient with CAP who is responding to initial therapy; and recommendations for the use of pneumococcal and influenza vaccines.\n<b> </b></p><p><b>Likely Pathogens and Patient Stratification\n</b> </p><p>All CAP patients fall into one of four groups, each with a list of likely pathogens, and suggested empiric therapy follows from this list (\n<i> </i></p><p><i>see\n</i> </p><p> Figure 1). Stratification is based on an assessment of place of therapy (outpatient, inpatient ward, or intensive care unit), the presence of cardiopulmonary disease, and the presence of \"modifying factors\" (\n<i> </i></p><p><i>see\n</i> </p><p> Table 1), which include risk factors for DRSP, enteric gram-negatives, and\n<i> </i></p><p><i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n</i> </p><p> Not every patient should be considered as being at risk for infection with DRSP, and clinical risk factors have been defined. The role of enteric gram-negatives in CAP is controversial, but these organisms do not need to be considered unless specific risk factors are present; however, one of these risk factors includes residence in a nursing home, a population that is not excluded from this statement.\n</p><p>For all patients with CAP, pneumococcus is the most common pathogen, and may even account for pneumonia in patients who have no pathogen identified by routine diagnostic testing. Although the incidence of DRSP is increasing, available data show that mortality in CAP is adversely affected by drug-resistant pneumococci only when minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values to penicillin are </p><p>  </p><p>4 mg/L. The impact of organisms at lower levels of resistance remains uncertain. All patients with CAP could potentially be infected with <i> </i></p><p><i>Chlamydia pneumoniae\n</i> </p><p>, <i> </i></p><p><i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae\n</i> </p><p>, and <i> </i></p><p><i>Legionella\n</i> </p><p> spp. (the \"atypical\" pathogens), either alone or as part of a mixed infection, and thus all patients should receive therapy to account for this possibility. Although the term \"atypical pneumonia\" is not an accurate description of the clinical features of CAP, the use of the term \"atypical\" was retained in this statement to refer to the specific pathogens listed above. When patients with CAP are admitted to the ICU, the organisms responsible include pneumococcus, the \"atypical\" pathogens (especially <i> </i></p><p><i>Legionella\n</i> </p><p>in some series), and enteric gram-negatives. <i> </i></p><p><i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n</i> </p><p> has been recovered from some patients with severe CAP, but this organism should be considered only when patients have well-identified risk factors present.\n<b> </b></p><p><b>Diagnostic Testing\n</b> </p><p>All patients with CAP should have a chest radiograph to establish the diagnosis and the presence of complications (pleural effusion, multilobar disease), although in some outpatient settings, this may be impossible. All outpatients should have a careful assessment of disease severity, but sputum culture and Gram's stain are not required. All admitted patients with CAP should have an assessment of gas exchange (oximetry or arterial blood gas), routine blood chemistry and blood counts, and a collection of two sets of blood cultures. If a drug-resistant pathogen, or an organism not covered by usual empiric therapy, is suspected, sputum culture should be obtained, and Gram's stain should be used to guide interpretation of culture results. In general, sputum Gram's stain cannot be used to focus initial empiric antibiotic therapy, but could be used to broaden initial antibiotic therapy to include organisms found on the Gram's stain that are not covered by the usual initial empiric antibiotic therapy options. Routine serologic testing is not recommended for any population with CAP. For patients with severe CAP, <i> </i></p><p><i>Legionella\n</i> </p><p> urinary antigen should be measured, and aggressive efforts at establishing an etiologic diagnosis should be made, including the collection of bronchoscopic samples of lower respiratory secretions in selected patients, although the benefit of such efforts has not been proven.\n<b> </b></p><p><b>Admission Decision and Need for ICU Care\n</b> </p><p>The admission decision remains an \"art of medicine\" decision, and prognostic scoring rules (the Pneumonia Patient Out-\n</p><p>This statement was supported by an educational grant from Pfizer, Inc.

In general, hospitalization is needed if patients have multiple risk factors for a complicated course, and these are summarized in this document. Patients may also need to be hospitalized for a variety of nonmedical reasons, and such social factors should also be incorporated into the admission decision process.\n</p><p>Admission to the ICU is needed for patients with severe CAP, defined as the presence of either one of two major criteria, or the presence of two of three minor criteria. The major criteria include need for mechanical ventilation and septic shock; the minor criteria include systolic blood pressure (BP) </p><p>  </p><p>90 mm Hg, multilobar disease, and Pa\n</p><p>O2\n</p><p>/F\n</p><p>IO2\n</p><p> ratio </p><p>  </p><p>250.

All populations should be treated for the possibility of atypical pathogen infection, and this should be with a macrolide (or tetracycline) alone in outpatients, or an intravenous macrolide alone in inpatients who have no risk factors for DRSP, gram-negatives, or aspiration. For outpatients or non-ICU inpatients with risk factors for these other organisms, therapy should be with either a </p><p> \n</p><p>-lactam/macrolide combination or an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone alone. Although both regimens appear therapeutically equivalent, particularly among inpatients, in the outpatient treatment of the more complicated patient, an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone may be more convenient than a </p><p> \n</p><p>-lactam/macrolide combination. All admitted patients should receive their first dose of antibiotic therapy within 8 h of arrival to the hospital. In the ICU-admitted patient, current data do not support the use of an anti-pneumococcal fluoroquinolone alone, and therapy should be with a </p><p> \n</p><p>-lactam plus either a macrolide or quinolone, using a regimen with two antipseudomonal agents in appropriate, at-risk, patients.\n</p><p>If a </p><p> \n</p><p>-lactam/macrolide combination is used for a patient with risk factors for DRSP, only selected </p><p> \n</p><p>-lactams can be used, and these include oral therapy with cefpodoxime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, high-dose amoxicillin, or cefuroxime; or intravenous therapy with ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ampicillin/ sulbactam, or high-dose ampicillin. Ceftriaxone can also be given intramuscularly. There are several antibiotics, such as cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobac-tam that are generally clinically active against DRSP, but since these agents are also active against </p><p><i>P. aeruginosa\n</i></p><p>, they should be reserved for patients with risk factors for this organism.\n</p><p><b>Clinical Response, Switch to Oral Therapy, and Discharge </b></p><p>Most patients with CAP will have an adequate clinical response within 3 d, and when the patient has met appropriate criteria, switch to oral therapy should be made. Criteria for switch include improvement in cough and dyspnea; afebrile (\n</p><p>  </p><p>100\n</p><p> \n</p><p> F) on two occasions 8 h apart; white blood cell count decreasing; and functioning gastrointestinal tract with adequate oral intake. Even if the patient is febrile, switch therapy can occur, if other clinical features are favorable. If the patient\n</p><p>has met criteria for switch, oral therapy can be started and the patient discharged on the same day, if other medical and social factors permit.\n</p><p>For most patients, initial antibiotic therapy should not be changed in the first 72 h, unless there is a marked clinical deterioration. Up to 10% of all CAP patients will not respond to initial therapy, and a diagnostic evaluation is necessary to look for a drug-resistant or unusual (or unsuspected) pathogen, a nonpneumonia diagnosis (inflammatory disease or pulmonary embolus), or a pneumonia complication. This evaluation begins with a careful requestioning about epidemiologic factors that predispose to specific pathogens (\n</p><p><i>see\n</i></p><p> Table 6).\n</p><p><b>Prevention\n</b></p><p>Pneumonia can be prevented by the use of pneumococcal and influenza vaccines in appropriate at-risk populations.

In the United States, pneumonia is the sixth leading cause of death, and the number one cause of death from infectious diseases (1, 2). Because pneumonia is not a reportable illness, information about its incidence is based on crude estimates, but it appears that up to 5.6 million cases of community-acquired pneumonia occur annually, and as many as 1.1 million of these require hospitalization (1, 2). In the outpatient setting, the mortality rate of pneumonia remains low, in the range of </p><p>  </p><p>1-5%, but among patients with community-acquired pneumonia who require hospitalization, the mortality rate averages 12% overall, but increases in specific populations, such as those with bacteremia, and those from nursing home settings, and approaches 40% in those who are most ill and who require admission to the intensive care unit (3-26).\n</p><p>Both the epidemiology and treatment of pneumonia have undergone changes. Pneumonia is increasingly being recognized among older patients and those with comorbidity (coexisting illness) (2, 15, 18, 19, 21). Such illnesses include chronic obstructive lung disease, diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, malignancy, chronic neurologic disease, and chronic liver disease (15). These individuals may become infected with a variety of newly identified, or previously unrecognized, pathogens (5, 14, 17, 27-32). At the same time, a number of new antimicrobial agents have become available, some with utility for community-acquired pneumonia. Paralleling the improvement in our antibiotic armamentarium has been the evolution of bacterial resistance mechanisms. In the 1990s, many of the common respiratory pathogens have become resistant, </p><p><i>in vitro\n</i></p><p>, to widely used antimicrobials. Resistance, by a variety of mechanisms, is being identified with increasing frequency among </p><p><i>Streptococcus pneumoniae\n</i></p><p>, </p><p><i>Hemophilus influenzae\n</i></p><p>, </p><p><i>Moraxella catarrha-lis\n</i></p><p>, and a number of enteric gram-negative bacteria (33-39). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common illness, affecting up to 15 million persons in the United States, with more than 12 million having a component of illness characterized as chronic bronchitis, and these patients commonly develop community-acquired respiratory infections, including pneumonia (40). COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States, and age-adjusted death rates in this illness have risen, whereas other common causes of death such as heart disease and cerebral vascular disease have fallen (40-\n</p><p>42). This population is prone to frequent acute bronchitic exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), and bacterial infection is believed to play a role in at least half of these episodes (43). Although most experts agree that antibiotics should not be used in patients with acute bronchitis in the absence of chronic lung disease, the role of antibiotic therapy in AECB is controversial, with some patients receiving such therapy and others not. At the current time, the role of antibiotic therapy in this illness is uncertain, and it remains unclear whether specific subpopulations of patients with AECB can be defined for the purpose of prescribing different therapy to different patients. In 1993, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) published guidelines for the initial management of community-acquired pneumonia, based on available knowledge and a consensus of experts (44). Since that time, new information has become available in many areas related to this illness, including prognostic scoring to predict mortality, new knowledge of the bacteriology of this illness, and new approaches to providing care in a cost-effective and efficient manner. Since 1993, a number of new antibiotics have been approved for the therapy of CAP, in at least four different drug classes. At the same time,\n</p><p><i>in vitro\n</i></p><p> antibiotic resistance among the organisms causing CAP has become increasingly prevalent, and the clinical relevance of resistance is beginning to be understood.\n</p><p><b>Goals of This Document\n</b></p><p>This document is a revision of the initial CAP guidelines, intended to update and expand on the original statement, by including more recent information as well as by covering new areas such as pneumonia prevention and the importance of drug-resistant organisms. It includes not only elements from the original ATS CAP guidelines, but also takes into account the recommendations from the more recently published guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA, Alexandria, VA) and the newly published Canadian CAP document (45, 46). The discussion is limited to the apparently immunocompetent patient with community-acquired pneumonia, because this represents the population most commonly encountered. However, patients with immune suppression due to chronic corticosteroid therapy and due to nonhe-matologic malignancy (without neutropenia) are commonly treated by many types of physicians, and the approach to these patients is included in this document. The approach to other immunocompromised patients is different, because of the large number of potential etiologic agents for pneumonia in these individuals. Thus the discussion does not deal with the problems of pneumonia in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patient, or in those immunocompromised as a result of myelosuppressive chemotherapy, organ transplantation, or \"traditional\" immunosuppressive illnesses, such as Hodgkin's disease.\n</p><p>The goal of this statement is to provide a framework for the\n</p><p><i>evaluation and therapy\n</i></p><p> of the patient with community-acquired pneumonia. The most common pathogens have been defined from published studies, and the determination of which diagnostic tests should be obtained routinely has been made on the basis of published data. While organism-directed antimicrobial therapy would be ideal because of reduced costs, reduction in adverse drug reactions, and antibiotic selection pressure, the limitations of our current diagnostic methods force us to rely on empiric antibiotic therapy in most patients with CAP. The approach to such therapy must be based on an assessment of the likelihood that a given pathogen is causing disease in a given patient, a determination guided by information from the literature. The major variables that influence the spectrum of etiologic agents and the initial approach to therapy are the severity of illness at initial presentation, the presence of coexisting illness, and the presence of identified clinical risk factors for drug-resistant and unusual pathogens (Table 1). Patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia have a distinct epidemiology and a somewhat different distribution of etiologic pathogens than do patients with other forms of pneumonia (8, 9, 16, 19, 20, 23, 24, 47, 48). Once empiric therapy has been initiated, other decisions, such as the duration of therapy and the change from parenteral to oral therapy, become relevant. Finally, it is inevitable that empiric therapy will not be successful for all patients, and thus an approach is provided for use if the patient is not responding to the selected regimen.\n</p><p><b>Methodology Used to Prepare This Document\n</b></p><p>The development of these guidelines was by a committee composed of pulmonary, critical care, infectious disease, and general internal medicine specialists, in an effort to incorporate a variety of perspectives and to create a statement that was acceptable to a wide range of physicians. The committee originally met as a group, with each individual being assigned a topic for review and presentation to the entire group, during a two-day meeting. Each topic in the guideline was reviewed by more than one committee member, and following presentation of information, the committee discussed the data and formulated its recommendations. Each section of the statement was then prepared by committee members, and a draft document incorporating all sections was written. This document was circulated to the committee for review and modification and then the committee met again in May of 2000 to deliberate on suggested changes. The manuscript was then revised and circulated to the committee for final comment. This final statement represents the results of this process and the opinions of the majority of the committee. For any topic in which there was disagreement, the majority position was adopted. We used an evidence-based approach for making final recommendations, after review of all available and relevant peer-reviewed studies (collected by literature search and selected by the experts reviewing each topic), published until Decem-ber 2000. Much of the literature on the etiology, epidemiology, and diagnostic approach to respiratory infections is observational, and only a few therapy trials have been conducted in a prospective randomized fashion. Therefore, in grading the evidence supporting our recommendations, we used the following scale, similar to the approach used in the recently updated Canadian CAP statement (46): Level I evidence comes from well-conducted randomized controlled trials; Level II evidence comes from well-designed, controlled trials without\n</p><p><b>TABLE 1.

Level II studies included any large case series in which systematic analysis of disease patterns and/or microbial etiology was conducted, as well as reports of new therapies that were not collected in a randomized fashion. In some instances therapy recommendations come from antibiotic susceptibility data, without clinical observations, and these constitute Level III recommendations.\n</p><p>While numerous studies detailing the incidence and etiology of pneumonia have been published, all have limitations. The approach used in this statement is based on an evaluation of studies that were long enough to avoid seasonal bias and recent enough to include newly recognized pathogens. Therefore, we reviewed the available literature, emphasizing data from prospective studies of one or more years' duration, reported in the past 15 years, involving adults in North America and elsewhere (3-32, 37, 38, 47). We focused on studies that included an extensive diagnostic approach to define the etiologic pathogen, and which did not rely on sputum Gram's stain and culture alone for this determination. Most involved hospitalized patients, but a wide spectrum of patients was included, ranging from outpatients to those admitted to an intensive care unit. In some of the studies, patients were receiving antimicrobials at the time of initial diagnostic evaluation, and the committee considered information from such studies of uncertain reliability.\n</p><p><b>ETIOLOGY OF COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA\n</b></p><p><b>Types of Data Reviewed\n</b></p><p>While a rapid diagnosis is optimal in the management of community-acquired pneumonia, the responsible pathogen is not defined in as many as 50% of patients, even when extensive diagnostic testing is performed (3-5, 13-15). No single test is presently available that can identify all potential pathogens, and each diagnostic test has limitations. For example, sputum Gram's stain and culture may be discordant for the presence of\n</p><p><i>Streptococcus pneumoniae\n</i></p><p>, and these tests are also not able to detect frequently encountered pathogens such as </p><p><i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae\n</i></p><p>, </p><p><i>Chlamydia pneumoniae\n</i></p><p>, </p><p><i>Legionella\n</i></p><p> spp., and respiratory viruses (49, 50). In addition, several studies have reported that some patients with CAP can have mixed infection involving both bacterial and \"atypical\" pathogens. This type of mixed infection may require therapy of all the identified pathogens, but cannot be diagnosed initially with readily available clinical specimens (13, 15, 17). In addition, mixed infection can involve more than one bacterial species, or can involve both a bacterial pathogen and a viral organism (13, 17, 28).\n</p><p>The role of \"atypical\" pathogens is controversial because the frequency of these organisms is largely dependent on the diagnostic tests and criteria used, and it is uncertain whether these organisms infect along with a bacterial pathogen, or if they cause an initial infection that then predisposes to secondary bacterial infection (13, 17, 28). The very term \"atypical\" pathogen is potentially misleading since the clinical syndrome caused by these organisms is not distinctive (\n</p><p><i>see below\n</i></p><p>), but in this statement the term \"atypical\" is used to refer to a group of organisms (\n</p><p><i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae\n</i></p><p>, </p><p><i>Chlamydia pneumoniae\n</i></p><p>, </p><p><i>Legionella\n</i></p><p> spp.), rather than to a clinical picture. The data supporting the presence of atypical pathogen coinfection (which has varied in frequency from as low as 3% to as high as 40%) have generally been derived by serologic testing, documenting fourfold rises in titers to </p><p><i>M. pneumoniae\n</i></p><p>, </p><p><i>C. pneumoniae\n</i></p><p>, or Legionella spp., and some of these diagnoses have even been made with single high acute titers (14, 17). Since many of these diagnoses have not\n</p><p>involved testing for the surface antigens of these pathogens, or cultures of respiratory secretions, the clinical significance of the serologic data remains uncertain.\n</p><p>In defining the bacteriology of CAP, we examined the likely etiologic pathogens for each patient category, adding new information about the emerging resistance of common CAP pathogens such as pneumococcus, </p><p><i>H. influenzae\n</i></p><p>, and\n</p><p><i>M. catarrhalis\n</i></p><p> (33-39). In addition, there is now an increased awareness of the importance of newly recognized pathogens (such as hantavirus) and of \"atypical\" pathogens. In most studies, a large number of patients have no defined etiology. This is likely a reflection of a number of factors, including prior treatment with antibiotics, the presence of unusual pathogens that go unrecognized (fungi, </p><p><i>Coxiella burnetii\n</i></p><p>), the presence of viral infection, the presence of a noninfectious mimic of CAP, and the presence of pathogens that are currently not identified or recognized.\n</p><p><b>Organisms Causing CAP in Outpatients\n</b></p><p>Relatively few studies have been conducted in ambulatory patients with CAP and in this group an unknown diagnosis is present in 40-50% of all patients (11, 12, 30, 31, 51). When a pathogen has been identified, the nature of the organisms has reflected the population studied and the types of diagnostic tests performed. With use of sputum culture, pneumococcus is the most commonly identified pathogen (9-20% of all episodes), while </p><p><i>M. pneumoniae\n</i></p><p> is the most common organism (accounting for 13-37% of all episodes) identified when serologic testing is performed (11, 12, 51). </p><p><i>Chlamydia pneumoniae\n</i></p><p> has been reported in up to 17% of outpatients with CAP (51). In the outpatient setting, </p><p><i>Legionella\n</i></p><p> spp. have also been seen, with rates varying from 0.7 to 13% of all patients (30). The incidence of viral infection is variable, but in one series was identified in 36% of patients (30). The incidence of gram-negative infection in ambulatory patients is difficult to define from currently available studies, but the complexity of the population that is currently treated out of the hospital is increasing, and many of these patients have well-identified risk factors for colonization of the respiratory tract by gram-negative bacilli, a common predisposing factor to pneumonia with these pathogens (52).\n</p><p><b>Organisms Causing CAP in Non-ICU-Hospitalized Patients\n</b></p><p>On the basis of a review of 15 published studies from North America, over 3 decades in primarily hospitalized patients, Bartlett and Mundy (22) concluded that </p><p><i>S. pneumoniae\n</i></p><p> was the most commonly identified pathogen (20-60% of all episodes), followed by </p><p><i>H. influenzae\n</i></p><p> (3-10% of all episodes), and then by </p><p><i>Staphylococcus aureus\n</i></p><p>, enteric gram-negatives, </p><p><i>Le-gionella\n</i></p><p>, </p><p><i>M. pneumoniae\n</i></p><p>, </p><p><i>C. pneumoniae\n</i></p><p>, and viruses (up to 10% of episodes for each of these latter agents). In addition, some patients (3-6%) have pneumonia due to aspiration. In all studies, an etiologic agent was not found in 20-70% of patients (4, 5, 8, 13, 14, 18, 21). For many years, patients with an unknown diagnosis were assumed to have the same distribution of pathogens as those with an established diagnosis, since the outcomes in both groups were similar, but one study of hospitalized patients suggested that many patients without a known diagnosis actually have pneumococcal infection (53). In several studies of hospitalized patients with CAP, there has been a high incidence of atypical pathogen infection, primarily </p><p><i>M. pneumoniae\n</i></p><p> and </p><p><i>C. pneumoniae\n</i></p><p> among those outside the ICU, while the incidence of </p><p><i>Legionella\n</i></p><p> infection has been low in patients who are not admitted to the ICU (8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17). The incidence of infection with these \"atypical\" organisms has been as high as 40-60% of all admitted patients, often as part of a mixed infection, but the findings have not been corroborated by all investigators (13, 17, 54). This high\nincidence was identified primarily by serologic testing that included single high acute titers as well as a 4-fold rise between acute and convalescent titers, but the serologic criteria and diagnostic tests used for these organisms are not standardized, and include the use of IgG and IgM titers. When atypical pathogens have been identified, they have not been confined to the population of young and healthy patients, but rather have been found in patients of all age groups (14). Even in series that do not identify a high incidence of atypical pathogens, they are often part of a mixed infection when they are identified (13, 54). The importance of mixed infection is also uncertain, with some investigators reporting that coinfection with bacterial and atypical pathogens leads to a more complicated course than monomicrobial infection, while others report no impact on the clinical course (28, 54). On the basis of these data, it is difficult to define the importance of these organisms and the need for specific therapy. However, several outcome studies show that both inpatients and outpatients have a less complicated clinical course if a macrolide is used as part of the therapy regimen, or if a quinolone is used alone (55-58). Enteric gram-negative bacteria are not common in CAP, but may be present in up to 10% of non-ICU-hospitalized patients. They have been found most commonly in those who have underlying comorbid illness (particularly COPD) on previous oral antibiotic therapy, in those coming from nursing homes, and those with hematologic malignancy or immune suppression (the latter not being covered in this statement) (8, 15, 16, 18, 19). In one study, enteric gram-negatives were identified in 9% of patients, and in 11% of all pathogens, and the presence of any of the following comorbidities was associated with an increased risk of infection (odds ratio 4.4) with these organisms: cardiac illness, chronic lung disease, renal insufficiency, toxic liver disease, chronic neurologic illness, diabetes, and malignancy active within the last year (15). Although the incidence of </p><p><i>P. aeruginosa\n</i></p><p> infection is not high in most patients with CAP, this organism was found in 4% of all CAP patients with an established etiologic diagnosis (14, 15). There is still controversy about the true incidence of gram-negative infection in patients with CAP, since diagnostic testing that involves sputum culture cannot always distinguish between colonization by these organisms and true infection. The incidence of gram-negative infection is not as high in all admitted patients with CAP, but rises among those admitted to the ICU, as discussed below (8, 16, 20, 47).\n</p><p><b>Organisms Causing CAP in Hospitalized Patients Requiring ICU Admission\n</b></p><p>While gram-negative aerobic organisms have been identified with an increased frequency in patients with CAP requiring intensive care, the most common organisms in patients falling into this category are pneumococcus, </p><p><i>Legionella\n</i></p><p>, and </p><p><i>H. influ-enzae\n</i></p><p>, with some series reporting </p><p><i>S. aureus\n</i></p><p> as a common pathogen (8, 9, 16, 23). In addition, atypical pathogens such as\n</p><p><i>C. pneumoniae\n</i></p><p> and </p><p><i>M. pneumoniae\n</i></p><p> can lead to severe illness, and in at least one study, these organisms were more common than </p><p><i>Legionella\n</i></p><p> in causing severe CAP (16). Overall, up to 10% of admitted patients with CAP are brought to the ICU, and pneumococcus is present in up to one-third of all patients (8, 9, 16, 20). Among patients admitted to the ICU, organisms such as </p><p><i>P. aeruginosa\n</i></p><p> have been identified, particularly in individuals with underlying bronchiectasis (8, 16, 20, 47). In this population, the Enterobacteriaceae have been found in up to 22% of patients, and up to an additional 10-15% of ICU patients in some series have infection with </p><p><i>P. aeruginosa\n</i></p><p> (20, 23, 47). In all of these series, 50-60% of patients with severe CAP have an unknown etiology, and the failure to define a pathogen in these patients has not been associated with a different outcome than if a pathogen is identified (20, 24).\n</p><p><b>Drug-resistant Pneumococcus in CAP\n</b></p><p>The emergence of DRSP is an increasingly common problem in the United States and elsewhere, with more than 40% of all pneumococci falling into this category by current </p><p><i>in vitro\n</i></p><p> definitions of resistance (35, 59-60a). Controversy continues, however, about the clinical relevance of </p><p><i>in vitro\n</i></p><p> resistance in the absence of meningitis, and whether the problem, as currently defined, requires new therapeutic approaches or whether the presence of resistance influences the outcome of CAP (33, 34, 37, 38, 59, 60). The current definitions of resistance include \"intermediate-level\" resistance with penicillin MIC values of 0.12-1.0 </p><p> \n</p><p>g/ml, while \"high-level\" resistance is defined as MIC values of </p><p>  </p><p>2.0 </p><p> \n</p><p>g/ml (60). When resistance to penicillin is present, there is often </p><p><i>in vitro\n</i></p><p> resistance to other agents, including cephalosporins, macrolides, doxycycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxizole (35, 60a). In one survey, with isolates collected as recently as 1998, when high-level penicillin resistance was present, </p><p><i>in vitro\n</i></p><p> resistance to cefotaxime was 42%, to meropenem 52%, to erythromycin 61%, and to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxizole 92% (60a). The newer antipneumo-coccal fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, trovafloxacin, and sparfloxacin), the ketolides, and vancomycin are active agents for DRSP, and linezolid, a newly available oxazolidinone, is also active against DRSP. Although quinolone resistant pneumococci have been uncommon, one recent report found that 2.9% of pneumococcal isolates from adults were ciprofloxacin resistant and that 4.1% of isolates with high level penicillin resistance were also quinolone (ciprofloxa-cin) resistant (61). When ciprofloxacin resistance was present, </p><p><i>in vitro\n</i></p><p> resistance to the newer quinolones was also present.\n</p><p>The clinical relevance of DRSP has been debated, but in the absence of meningitis, clinical failure with high-dose </p><p> \n</p><p>-lactam therapy is currently unlikely (60). Using currently defined levels of resistance, most investigators have found no difference in mortality for patients infected with resistant or sensitive organisms, after controlling for comorbid illness, although patients with resistant organisms may have a more prolonged hospital stay (33, 34). One study has shown that suppurative complications (such as empyema) are more common in patients with penicillin-nonsusceptible organisms than in patients with susceptible organisms, even though the majority of patients received apparently adequate therapy (62). In Spain, where the incidence of high-level DRSP is higher than in the United States, the presence of resistance has been reported to cause a rise in mortality, which was not statistically significant (38). In another study of a population with a high incidence of HIV infection, the presence of high-level penicillin resistance (as defined above) was associated with increased mortality, in spite of most patients receiving therapy that appeared to be appropriate (63). A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, Atlanta, GA) study has shown that the breakpoint for clinically relevant resistance to penicillin is an MIC value of </p><p>  </p><p>4.0 </p><p> \n</p><p>g/ml (37). At these levels, resistance was associated with increased mortality in patients with invasive disease (primarily bacteremia), provided that patients dying in the first 4 d of therapy were excluded from the analysis (37). When these levels of resistance are suspected (or documented), alternative agents to penicillin should be used, and these are discussed below, although routine therapy with vancomycin is rarely needed (60).\n</p><p>Not all patients in areas with high geographic rates of DRSP are likely to be infected with these organisms, and even in areas with high rates of resistance, organisms isolated from sputum and blood cultures are less commonly resistant than or-\nganisms isolated from the upper respiratory tract (64). Identified risk factors for DRSP include age </p><p>  </p><p>65 years (odds ratio [OR], 3.8), alcoholism (OR, 5.2), noninvasive disease (suggesting possibly reduced virulence of resistant organisms) (OR, 4.5), </p><p> \n</p><p>-lactam therapy within 3 mo (OR, 2.8), multiple medical comorbidities, exposure to children in a day care center, and immunosuppressive illness (38, 59, 65, 66). In one study, the effect of age was less clear, with individuals </p><p>  </p><p>age 65 yr having an odds ratio of 1.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-1.5) corresponding to an incidence of DRSP of 24%, compared with an incidence of 19% in those aged 18-64 yr (60a).\n</p><p><b>PATIENT STRATIFICATION\n</b></p><p><b>Features Used to Define Patient Subsets\n</b></p><p>We divided patients into four groups on the basis of place of therapy (outpatient, hospital ward, or intensive care unit); the presence of coexisting cardiopulmonary disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure); and the presence of \"modifying factors,\" which included the presence of risk factors for drug-resistant pneumococcus, the presence of risk factors for gram-negative infection (including nursing home residence), and the presence of risk factors for <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> (specifically in patients requiring ICU admission) (Table 1) (15, 19, 27). The history of cigarette smoking was not used to classify patients, since all of the recommended therapy regimens account for <i>H. influenzae</i>, the organism that is more likely to occur in smokers than in nonsmokers. In this approach to stratification, the place of therapy is a reflection of severity of illness, with the need for hospitalization and the need for ICU admission being defined by the criteria described in subsequent sections of this statement.\n</p><p>In the previous version of the ATS CAP guidelines, age was used as a major discriminating factor among patients to define bacterial etiology. This concept has not been corroborated by studies that have shown that age alone, in the absence of comorbid illness, has little impact on the bacterial etiology of CAP (18, 19, 67). As discussed above, the elderly patient can have infection by \"atypical\" pathogens, and enteric gram-negatives are common primarily in those with comorbid illness (particularly underlying COPD), recent antibiotic therapy, and in patients residing in nursing homes (8, 15). One pathogen whose presence may be impacted by age alone is drug-resistant <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> (DRSP), with several studies showing that age   65 is, by itself, a specific epidemiologic risk for CAP due to this organism, but is not an independent risk factor for other organisms (38, 59).\n</p><p>Risk factors for penicillin and drug-resistant pneumococcus were defined from the literature, and are summarized in Table 1. Risk factors for enteric gram-negatives include residence in a nursing home, underlying cardiopulmonary disease, multiple medical comorbidities, and recent antibiotic therapy (15, 18, 19, 52). The risk factors for <i>P. aeruginosa</i> include the presence of any of the following: structural lung disease such as bronchiectasis, corticosteroid therapy (  10 mg of prednisone per day), broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy for   7 d in the past month, malnutrition, and leukopenic immune suppression (the latter is not included in this statement) (8, 15, 16, 68).\n</p><p><b>Patient Subsets\n</b></p><p>Using these factors, the four patient groups were defined (Tables 2-5 and Figure 1) as the following:\n</p><p>I. Outpatients with no history of cardiopulmonary disease, and no modifying factors (Table 2)\n</p><p>II. Outpatients with cardiopulmonary disease (congestive heart failure or COPD) and/or other modifying factors (risk factors for DRSP or gram-negative bacteria) (Table 3)\n</p><p>III.

Risks for <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n</i></p><p>For each group, results from available studies were combined to identify the most common pathogens associated with pneumonia and an attempt was made to rank the incidence of pathogens broadly, but a precise numeric incidence or percentage was not included. Patients with nursing home-acquired pneumonias were included, with the realization that this population is unique, and that a knowledge of local (institution-specific) epidemics and antibiotic susceptibility patterns is necessary to choose optimal empiric therapy. However, the following pathogens are recognized more frequently in nursing home patients than in patients with the same coexisting illnesses who are residing in the community: methicillin-resistant <i>S. aureus</i> (MRSA), enteric gram-negative bacteria,\n<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, and certain viral agents (i.e., adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], and influenza) (18, 69-71). A miscellaneous group is included in each of Tables 2- 5 and represents organisms that were present in about 1% of patients in these studies, or pathogens that have been otherwise reported to occur in this setting.\n</p><p><b>Specific Pathogens for Each Patient Subset\n</b></p><p>The most common pathogens in Group I, that is, outpatients with no cardiopulmonary disease and no risks for DRSP or gram-negatives, include <i>S. pneumoniae</i>, <i>M. pneumoniae</i>, <i>C. pneumoniae</i>, and respiratory viruses (<i>Level II evidence</i>). Miscellaneous pathogens include <i>Legionella</i> sp. (usually a more severe illness), <i>M. tuberculosis</i>, and endemic fungi. Although\n<i>H. influenzae</i> can be seen in this group of patients, it is a particular concern if the patient has a history of cigarette smoking. This population has a mortality rate of   1-5% (10,72). For patients in Group II, the presence of cardiopulmonary disease (congestive heart failure or COPD), or the presence of\n</p><p><b>TABLE 2.

Although pneumococcus remains the most likely pathogen, resistance to penicillin and other agents (mac-rolides, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxizole) is more likely, and this should be considered in antibiotic selection (below). In addition, if the patient is from a nursing home, then aerobic gram-negative infection is possible and can include the Enter-obacteriaceae such as <i>Escherichia coli</i>, or <i>Klebsiella</i> spp., and even <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (if bronchiectasis is present) (<i>Level II evidence</i>). Also, in this population, aspiration with anaerobes should be considered in the presence of poor dentition and if the patient has a history of neurologic illness, impaired consciousness, or a swallowing disorder. Less common pathogens include <i>Moraxella</i> <i>catarrhalis</i>, <i>Legionella</i> sp., <i>Mycobacterium\n</i>sp., and endemic fungi. Mortality in this setting is also   5%, but as many as 20% of patients initially treated as outpatients may require hospitalization (72).\n</p><p>When the patient is hospitalized, there are usually risks for DRSP and enteric gram-negatives, or underlying cardiopulmonary disease, and these factors influence the likely pathogens (Group IIIa). These patients are at risk for infection with pneumococcus, <i>H. influenzae</i>, atypical pathogens (alone or as a mixed infection), as well as enteric gram-negatives such as the Enterobacteriaceae, and also a polymicrobial bacterial flora including anaerobes associated with aspiration (if risk factors are present). All admitted patients are also at risk for\n<i>M. tuberculosis</i> and endemic fungi, but these are less commonly identified than the other organisms listed above. Tuberculosis is a particular concern in patients who have been born in foreign countries with high rates of endemic illness, in the alcoholic, and in the elderly who reside in nursing homes. Mortality rates reported for these patients ranged from 5 to 25%, and most of the deaths occurred within the first 7 d (3, 10). If, however, the admitted patient has no cardiopulmonary disease, and no risks for DRSP or gram-negatives (Group IIIb), then the most likely pathogens are <i>S. pneumoniae</i>, <i>H. influen-\n</i></p><p><i>zae</i>, <i>M. pneumoniae</i>, <i>C. pneumoniae</i>, viruses, and possibly <i>Le-gionella</i> sp. (<i>Level II evidence</i>).\n</p><p>In some studies of admitted patients with CAP, the etiology may be polymicrobial. The incidence of \"mixed\" infection, usually a bacterial pathogen and an \"atypical\" pathogen, varies from   10% to up to 40% (10, 12, 13, 17, 28). Atypical pathogens have been frequently identified in admitted patients of all age groups. The difference in relative incidence of \"mixed\" infections may relate to how aggressively investigators collected both acute and convalescent titers, and to the type of criteria used to define the presence of these pathogens (single-titer versus 4-fold rise in titers) (13, 17).\n</p><p>Severe community-acquired pneumonia (defined below) has been separated from cases of less severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization, because of the high mortality rate (up to 50%) and the need for immediate recognition of patients with this severity of illness (8-10, 16, 10, 24, 47, 48). Although severe pneumonia was defined differently by the various investigators, a practical approach defines all patients admitted to the ICU because of respiratory infection as having severe illness (<i>see below</i>) (48). The pathogens most frequently identified among patients with severe pneumonia (Group IVa) include\n<i>S. pneumoniae</i>, <i>Legionella</i> sp., <i>H. influenzae</i>, enteric gram-negative bacilli, <i>S. aureus</i>, <i>M.</i> <i>pneumoniae</i>, respiratory tract viruses, and a group of miscellaneous pathogens (<i>C. pneumo-niae</i>, <i>M.</i> <i>tuberculosis</i>, and endemic fungi) (8, 9, 16, 19, 20, 23, 47). In one study, the incidence of <i>Legionella</i> sp. in patients with severe CAP decreased over time, in one hospital, but was replaced by other atypical pathogens, such as <i>C. pneumoniae\n</i>and <i>M. pneumoniae</i> (16). There has been some debate about whether <i>P.</i> <i>aeruginosa</i> can lead to severe CAP, and although this organism has been reported in some studies (in 1.5-5% of such patients), the committee felt that this pathogen should be considered only when specific risk factors are present (Group IVb) (8, 16, 20, 47) (<i>Level III evidence</i>). These risks include chronic or prolonged (  7 d within the past month) broad-\n</p><p><b>TABLE 3.

Undiagnosed HIV infection has been identified as a risk factor for CAP due to <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (73). The frequency of <i>S. aureus\n</i>as a severe CAP pathogen is also variable, being present in anywhere from 1 to 22% of all patients. Risks for infection with this organism include recent influenza infection, diabetes, and renal failure (74).\n</p><p><b>DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES OF PATIENTS WITH COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA\n</b></p><p>The diagnosis of pneumonia should be considered in any patient who has newly acquired respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum production, and/or dyspnea), especially if accompanied by fever and auscultatory findings of abnormal breath sounds and crackles. In a patient with advanced age or an inadequate immune response, pneumonia may present with nonrespira-tory symptoms such as confusion, failure to thrive, worsening of an underlying chronic illness, or falling down (21, 71). In these patients, fever may be absent, but tachypnea is usually present, along with an abnormal physical examination of the chest (75). In the initial evaluation of the patient with CAP, the history may on occasion help to identify patients at risk for infection with specific organisms, as outlined in Table 6. Standard posteroanterior (PA) and lateral chest radiographs are valuable in patients whose symptoms and physical examination suggest the possibility of pneumonia, and every effort should be made to obtain this information. The radiograph can be useful in differentiating pneumonia from other conditions that may mimic it. In addition, the radiographic findings may suggest specific etiologies or conditions which as lung abscess, or tuberculosis. The radiograph can also identify coexisting conditions such as bronchial obstruction or pleural effusion. In some patients, the history and physical examination suggest the presence of pneumonia, but the radiograph is negative. One study has shown that some of these radiographically negative patients do have lung infiltrates if a high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest is done (76). However, the clinical relevance of these findings is uncertain, since most studies of CAP have required the presence of a lung infiltrate on a routine chest radiograph to define the presence of pneumonia. Radiography is also useful for evaluating severity of illness by identifying multilobar involvement (below). However, in certain outpatient settings, depending on the time of day and the availability of a radiology facility, it may be difficult to obtain a chest radiograph.\n</p><p>Once the diagnosis of CAP is established, an effort should be made to identify a specific etiologic diagnosis in a timely manner, with focused and appropriate diagnostic testing. However, even with extensive diagnostic testing, most investigators cannot identify a specific etiology for community-acquired pneumonia in up to half, or more, of all patients. If an exact etiology is identified, then therapy can be focused and cost-effective, but this goal needs to be tempered by two findings. First, if diagnostic testing leads to delays in the initiation of appropriate therapy, it may have an adverse outcome. One large Medicare study showed that 30-d CAP mortality was increased when administration of the first dose of antibiotic\n</p><p><b><i>Figure 1.\n</i></b></p><p><b>TABLE 5.

Second, since the possibility of coinfection is a consideration, with a bacteria and an atypical pathogen (which may take days or weeks to identify), the value of focused therapy, directed at a rapidly identified bacterial etiology, is uncertain. In fact, in large population studies, treatment that accounted for atypical pathogen coinfection led to a better outcome than treatment that did not account for this possibility (55-57) (<i>Level II evidence</i>).\n</p><p>One of the most controversial recommendations in the 1993 ATS guidelines for CAP was that a sputum Gram's stain and culture not be performed routinely in all admitted patients (44). Although its value is debated, some experts, including the IDSA consensus group, believe that a properly collected and examined Gram's stain of expectorated sputum is helpful for focusing initial empiric therapy in CAP (45). A lower respiratory tract sample that is not heavily contaminated by oral secretions will typically have fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, and   25 neutrophils per low-power field (45). Studies of the sputum Gram's stain have shown limitations, which include the following: not all patients can provide an adequate sample (either because of an inability to produce a sample, or because the sample is of poor quality), interpretation is observer dependent, atypical pathogens (which are common either singly or as coinfecting agents, as discussed above) cannot be seen, the definition of \"positive\" varies from study to study, and a positive result for pneumococcus is poorly predictive of the ability to recover that organism from a sputum or blood culture (49, 50). In addition, there are no studies correlating data from Gram's stain of expectorated sputum with cultures of alveolar material in large numbers of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. However, direct staining of sputum (non-Gram stain methods) may be diagnostic for some pulmonary infections including those due to <i>Mycobacterium</i> sp., endemic fungi, <i>Legionella</i> sp. (direct fluorescent antibody staining is required), and <i>Pneu-mocytis carinii.\n</i></p><p>If a sputum Gram's stain is used to determine initial therapy, the clinician must decide whether liberal criteria are being used to increase the sensitivity of the test (with a corresponding drop in specificity), or whether more stringent criteria are being used to increase the specificity of the test (with a corresponding drop in sensitivity) (49). The debate about the value of Gram's stain may be less relevant with the advent of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act, which has limited the use of this test to laboratory personnel who often interpret the results without knowledge of the clinical scenario and suspected pathogens.\n</p><p>Routine bacterial cultures of sputum often demonstrate pathogenic organisms, but sensitivity and specificity are poor, and findings should be correlated with the predominant organism identified on Gram's stain (50). However, recovery from cultures of organisms that are not usually part of the normal respiratory flora may be meaningful. Specialized cultures for <i>Mycobacterium</i> sp., <i>Legionella</i> sp., and endemic fungi may be valuable in the appropriate clinical circumstance. When drug-resistant pneumococci, other resistant pathogens, or organisms not covered by the usual empiric therapy options (such as\n<i>S. aureus</i>) are anticipated (particularly if the patient has risk factors, or is receiving antibiotics at the time of admission) sputum culture and sensitivity results may be useful. Viral cultures are not useful in the initial evaluation of patients with community-acquired pneumonia and should not be routinely performed (3). However, in the appropriate season, testing of respiratory secretions for influenza antigens, using rapid detection methods, may be helpful in guiding decisions about the use of new antiviral agents.\n</p><p><b>Recommended Testing\n</b></p><p>For the patient with CAP initially managed out of the hospital, diagnostic testing should include a chest radiograph and may include a sputum Gram's stain and culture, if drug-resistant bacteria, or an organism not covered by the usual empiric therapy options, are suspected (<i>Level II evidence</i>). In addition, it is necessary to assess severity of illness, relying on radiographic findings (multilobar pneumonia, pleural effusion), and physical findings (respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, signs of dehydration, and mental status) (78-80). If the patient has underlying chronic heart or lung disease, then assessment of oxygenation by pulse oximetry may help define the need for hospitalization and supplemental oxygen. Routine laboratory tests (complete blood counts, serum electrolytes, hepatic enzymes, and tests of renal function) are of little value in determining the etiology of pneumonia, but may have prognostic significance and influence the decision to hospitalize. They should be considered in patients who may need hospitalization, and in patients   age 65 yr or with coexisting illness (<i>Level II evidence</i>).\n</p><p>For the patient who is admitted, diagnostic testing should be performed rapidly, avoiding delays in the administration of initial empiric therapy, for the reasons stated above. In addition to a chest radiograph, an admitted patient should have a complete blood count and differential, and routine blood chemistry testing (including glucose, serum sodium, liver and renal function tests, and electrolytes) (<i>Level III evidence</i>). All admitted patients should have oxygen saturation assessed by oximetry. Arterial blood gas should be obtained in any patient with severe illness, or in any patient with chronic lung disease, to assess both the level oxygenation and the degree of carbon dioxide retention. Sputum cultures are recommended if a drug-resistant pathogen, or an organism not covered by usual em-\n</p><p><b>TABLE 6.

If a sputum culture is obtained, efforts should be made to collect it prior to antibiotic administration. Any culture result should be correlated with the predominant organism identified on Gram's stain of an appropriate specimen, which should be performed in conjuction with a sputum culture (<i>Level III evidence</i>). Otherwise, in the absence of a culture, a sputum Gram's stain is optional. However, it is the consensus of the majority of the CAP statement committee that if a sputum Gram's stain is used to guide initial therapy, it should be with highly sensitive criteria (any gram-positive diplococci, rather than a predominance of such organisms), with the primary purpose being to visualize a bacterial morphology of an organism that was not anticipated, so that appropriate drugs can be added to the initial antibiotic regimen (e.g., <i>S. aureus</i>, or enteric gram-negatives) (<i>Level III evidence</i>). This conclusion differs from that of the IDSA consensus group, which recommended using Gram's stain to narrow initial empiric therapy in patients with certain organism-specific findings (45). Two sets of blood cultures should be drawn before initiation of antibiotic therapy, and may help to identify the presence of bacteremia and of a resistant pathogen, with the overall yield being approximately 11%, and with <i>S. pneumoniae</i> being the most common pathogen identified by this method (46). Any significant pleural effusion (  10-mm thickness on lateral decubitus film) or any loculated pleural effusion should be sampled, preferably prior to the initiation of antibiotic therapy, to rule out the possibility of empyema or complicated parapneumonic effusion; however, there are no data showing an outcomes benefit to delaying antibiotic therapy for the purpose of performing a thoracentesis. Pleural fluid examination should include white blood cell count and differential; measurement of protein, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and pH; Gram's stain and acid-fast stain; as well as culture for bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria. Serologic testing and cold agglutinin measurements are not useful in the initial evaluation of patients with community-acquired pneumonia and should not be routinely performed (<i>Level II evidence</i>). However, acute and convalescent serologic testing may occasionally be useful for a retrospective confirmation of a suspected diagnosis and may be useful in epidemiologic studies. When <i>Legionella</i> is suspected (patients with severe CAP), measurement of urinary antigen is valuable, being positive in the majority of patients with acute <i>Legionella pneu-mophila</i> serogroup 1 infection, but the test can remain positive for many months after the acute infection (81, 82). Serial complement-fixing antibody titers may be useful in monitoring patients with extensive coccidioidomycosis, and sputum cultures for endemic fungi should be collected in at-risk patients with the proper epidemiologic history. Although patients known to be immune suppressed are excluded from this statement, HIV testing should be done (after informed consent) in any CAP patient with risk factors and should be considered in any patient aged 15-54 yr who is admitted for CAP (83). Specialized tests that measure microbial antigens by monoclonal antibodies, DNA probes, and polymerase chain reaction amplification are being developed, but have not been shown to be valuable for routine use in patients with CAP.\n</p><p>A number of invasive diagnostic techniques to obtain lower airway specimens, uncontaminated by oropharyngeal flora, have been described (45, 84, 85). These include transtracheal aspiration, bronchoscopy with a protected brush catheter, bronchoalveolar lavage with or without balloon protection, and direct percutaneous fine needle aspiration of the lung. These procedures are not indicated in most patients with community-acquired pneumonia (<i>Level III evidence</i>). It may be desirable to have an early accurate diagnosis in occasional patients who are severely ill, although retrospective data have shown that with severe illness, outcome is not improved by establishing a specific etiologic diagnosis (20, 24). In such patients, bronchoscopy with a protected brush catheter or bron-choalveolar lavage has a reasonable sensitivity and specificity when performed correctly. These procedures carry less risk and are usually more acceptable to patients and physicians than transtracheal aspiration and direct needle aspiration of the lung, although some physicians have special expertise in using ultrathin needles for direct lung aspiration.\n</p><p>Although the committee recommended limited initial diagnostic testing, it is necessary to do more extensive testing in patients whose illness is not resolving in spite of apparently appropriate empiric therapy (<i>see below</i>). As discussed above, this statement is not directed at patients known to be immune suppressed. Such patients require a different and more extensive diagnostic approach that reflects the wide range of potential pathogens in this population.\n</p><p><b>THE ROLE OF CLINICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS IN PREDICTING THE MICROBIAL ETIOLOGY OF CAP\n</b></p><p>The clinical features of CAP (symptoms, signs and radiographic findings) cannot be reliably used to establish the etiologic diagnosis of pneumonia with adequate sensitivity and specificity (<i>Level II evidence</i>). Although, in some circumstances, clinicians can confidently use clinical features to establish a specific etiologic diagnosis, in the majority of cases this is not possible. This relates not only to variations in virulence factors of particular pathogens, but also to the presence of coexisting illnesses, resulting in an overlap of clinical symptoms among various etiologic pathogens.\n</p><p><b>Typical versus Atypical Pneumonia Syndromes\n</b></p><p>Originally, the classification of pneumonia into \"atypical\" and \"typical\" forms arose from the observation that the presentation and natural history of some patients with pneumonia were different compared with those of patients with pneumococcal infection (86, 87). Some pathogens, such as <i>H. influenzae</i>, <i>S. aureus</i>, and gram-negative enteric bacteria, caused clinical syndromes identical to those produced by <i>S.</i> <i>pneumoniae</i> (88). However, other pathogens caused an \"atypical\" pneumonia syndrome that was initially attributed to <i>M. pneumoniae</i> (87), but other bacterial and viral agents have been identified that can produce a subacute illness indistinguishable from that caused by <i>M. pneumoniae</i> (89, 90). Some of these agents, however, like <i>Legionella</i> species and influenza, can cause a wide spectrum of illness, ranging from a fulminant life-threatening pneumonia to a more subacute presentation (90). Thus the term \"atypical\" pneumonia represents a clinical syndrome that includes diverse entities, and has limited clinical value.\n</p><p>The attribution of specific clinical features to an etiologic agent is a common clinical practice, particularly for patients suspected of having pneumonia caused by <i>Legionella</i> species. However, data have cast doubt on the specificity of these observations (4, 15, 18), leading to the conclusion that the diagnosis of\n<i>Legionella</i> sp. infection could not be made on clinical grounds alone. Other comparative studies involving both pediatric and adult populations, have concluded that an etiologic diagnosis could not be established by clinical criteria alone (91-93). In addition, no roentgenographic pattern is sufficiently distinctive to allow classification of individual cases (94, 95).\n</p><p>Advanced age and coexisting illness are important factors that affect the clinical presentation of pneumonia. Individuals over the age of 65 yr are particularly at risk for mortality from bacteremic pneumococcal disease, and among the elderly, the\ntion, to make a specific etiologic diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (<i>Level II evidence</i>).\n</p><p><b>THE DECISION TO HOSPITALIZE PATIENTS WITH COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA\n</b></p><p>The initial site-of-care decision is perhaps the single most important clinical decision made by physicians during the entire course of illness for patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). It has a direct bearing on the intensity of laboratory testing, microbiologic evaluation, antibiotic therapy, and costs of treating this illness. The estimated average cost of inpatient care for CAP is U.S. $7,500, compared with U.S. $150-$350 for outpatient care (2, 98).\n</p><p><b>Defining Risk Factors for a Complicated Course of CAP to Determine the Need for Admission\n</b></p><p>Studies have identified a series of risk factors that increase either the likelihood of death or the risk of a complicated course for community-acquired pneumonia (10, 72). When <i>multiple\n</i>risk factors coexist, the committee believed that hospitalization should be strongly <i>considered</i> (<i>Level II evidence</i>). The decision to hospitalize is not necessarily a commitment to long-term inpatient care but, rather, a decision that certain patients should be observed closely until it is clear that therapy can be safely continued out of the hospital. The admission decision may also be influenced by the availability of outpatient support services (home nursing, home intravenous therapy), and alternative sites for care (subacute care facilities). Since criteria for admission have not been uniformly applied by clinicians, studies have reported wide geographic variation in hospital admission rates for CAP (99). In addition, in some studies physicians have overestimated the risk of death for patients with CAP, leading to unnecessary admissions, while in other studies they have failed to recognize patients as being severely ill at the time of initial evaluation (72, 80).\n</p><p>Risk factors associated with an increased risk of death or a complicated course have been identified, and in one study, admitted patients had a mean of five risk factors present (57). All of these studies were observational, and the risk factors for an adverse outcome were defined only in hospitalized patients who had received antibiotics and supportive care for their illness, and the risk factors have not been studied in large numbers of outpatients. These factors include a number of features listed below, and those with an asterisk (*) are factors that have been identified to predict mortality in the PORT prediction rule model (72):\n</p><p>1. Age over 65 yr\n</p><p>2. Presence of coexisting illnesses such as chronic obstructive lung disease, bronchiectasis, malignancy (*), diabetes melli-tus, chronic renal failure (*), congestive heart failure (*), chronic liver disease (*), chronic alcohol abuse, malnutrition, cerebrovascular disease (*), and postsplenectomy. A history of hospitalization within the past year is also a risk factor\n</p><p>3. Certain physical findings also predict either mortality, increased morbidity, or a complicated course (10,79,80,100). These physical findings include a respiratory rate   30 breaths/min (*); diastolic blood pressure   60 mm Hg or an absolute neutrophil count below 1 109/L b. PaO2   60 mm Hg (*) or PaCO2 of   50 mm Hg while breathing room air\n</p><p>c. Evidence of abnormal renal function, as manifested by serum creatinine of   1.2 mg/dl or a BUN of   20 mg/ dl (  7 mM) (79)\n</p><p>d.Presence of certain unfavorable chest radiograph findings, for example, more than one lobe involvement, presence of a cavity, rapid radiographic spreading (which usually cannot be determined at the time of admission) (8); and the presence of a pleural effusion (*) (78) e. Hematocrit of   30% (*) or hemoglobin   9 mg/dl f. Evidence of sepsis or organ dysfunction as manifested by a metabolic acidosis, or coagulopathy g. Arterial pH   7.35 (*)\n</p><p>Social considerations also enter into the decision to hospitalize. The absence of a responsible caregiver in a stable home situation is a strong indication for hospitalization, at least for observation purposes. Since community-acquired pneumonia remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, the committee felt that the admission decision remains an \"art of medicine\" decision. Thus, when the overall appearance of the patient seems unfavorable, even if the above-mentioned criteria are not fully met, consideration should be given to placing the patient in the hospital on observation status for 24 to 48 h, or until such time as these concerns are resolved (<i>Level III evidence</i>). In studies where objective criteria for admission have been applied, at least 30% of \"low-risk\" patients have been admitted, reflecting the need to hospitalize some patients who do not meet objective standards (101) (<i>Level I evidence</i>).\n</p><p><b>Using Prognostic Scoring Systems to Define the Admission Decision\n</b></p><p>The above-described approach is not quantitative, and in the past 10 years, multiple studies have used multivariate analysis to develop prediction rules for outcome in CAP that could be used to help with the initial site of care decision (72, 102-104). However, none of these rules was specifically designed to define need for hospitalization. One approach, developed by the British Thoracic Society (BTS) Research Committee, was aimed at identifying high-risk patients who not only usually require admission, but who also often require ICU care (79, 80). The other approach, developed by the Pneumonia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT), separated patients into high and low risk of death, and that categorization has been extrapolated into defining the need for admission (72). These two prediction rules, developed and validated in different ways, are complementary. The BTS rule is focused on identifying high-risk patients so that their severity of illness is not underestimated, while the Pneumonia PORT approach is focused on recognizing some patients as low risk, so that their severity of illness is not overestimated.\n</p><p>The Pneumonia PORT prediction rule used a derivation cohort of 14,199 inpatients with CAP; it was independently validated in 38,039 inpatients with CAP and in 2,287 inpatients and outpatients prospectively enrolled in the Pneumonia PORT cohort study (72). One limitation in the derivation of this rule was that it included mostly patients seen in a hospital emer-\ngency department, and included few outpatients who were evaluated in a physician's office and sent home. In applying this rule, patients were stratified into five severity classes, using a two-step process that evaluated a number of demographic factors, comorbid illnesses, physical findings, and laboratory and radiographic data. In the derivation and validation of this rule, mortality ranged from 0.1 to 0.4% in Class I, 0.6 to 0.7% in Class II, and 0.9 to 2.8% in Class III. Mortality was intermediate for Class IV (8.2 to 9.3%) and high for Class V (27.0 to 31.1%). Increasing risk class was also associated with subsequent hospitalization among individuals initially managed as outpatients and with need for ICU admission (72).\n</p><p>On the basis of these observations, the Pneumonia PORT investigators hypothesized that patients in risk Class I or II be considered for outpatient treatment. Patients in risk Class III were potential candidates for outpatient treatment or brief inpatient observation, while traditional inpatient care should be provided for patients in Classes IV and V. No attempt was made to use risk stratification for the purpose of defining the need for admission to the ICU. Using this approach, they estimated that the proportion of patients receiving traditional inpatient care could be reduced by 31%. Of the Pneumonia PORT inpatients who would have been recommended for outpatient care under this strategy, 1% died and 4.3% were admitted to an ICU (72). If the strategy were amended to include traditional inpatient care for any patient (including those in low risk groups) with arterial hypoxemia (PO2   60 mm Hg or O2 saturation   90% on room air) at the time of presentation, then the reduction in inpatient care would have been slightly less dramatic, but the number of ICU admissions, for inpatients who were initially recommended for outpatient care, would have been reduced.\n</p><p>While the authors have extrapolated these data to define the need for hospitalization, the Pneumonia PORT prediction rule was actually derived to define mortality risk. In addition, it was never prospectively tested, during its development, for the purpose of defining the need for hospitalization. Prospective studies of the utility of the rule for deciding initial site of care of patients presenting to an emergency department (ED) have been published (101, 105). In one study, application of the Pneumonia PORT rule reduced the percentage of low-risk patients who were admitted (compared with a preceding control year) from 58 to 43%, but 9% of patients who were initially discharged according to the rule subsequently required admission (105). In another study conducted in 19 Canadian hospitals, 9 hospitals were randomized to use a critical pathway for pneumonia care that included calculation of the Pneumonia PORT severity index when patients arrived in the emergency department (101). Although the pathway recommended that patients in risk categories I-III be discharged, physician decision was allowed to supersede this guideline. In the hospitals that used the critical pathway, the number of low-risk patients admitted was significantly lower than in the hospitals that did not use the pathway. However, even with the use of the Pneumonia PORT rule, 31% of low-risk patients were admitted (compared with 49% in the control group). The patients in the critical pathway hospitals had the same outcome as those in the control hospitals. Since the pathway contained many interventions, the impact of any one factor (such as the Pneumonia PORT prediction rule) was not evaluated.\n</p><p>The BTS prediction rule was derived using 453 inpatients with CAP and was independently validated in 246 inpatients (79). The rule defines a patient as high risk for mortality if at least two of three features are present: respiratory rate   30/ min, diastolic blood pressure   60 mm Hg, and BUN   7.0 mM (  19.1 mg/dl). Patients with two or more of these prognostic factors had a relative risk of death of 21.1 (19.4 versus 0.9%) and 9.1 (28.6 versus 3.1%) in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. A fourth factor, confusion, has been added to the rule and in one study, patients with any two of these four factors present had a 36-fold increase in mortality compared with those without these findings (80). In addition, in that study, when calculated on admission, the BTS rule identified as severely ill 19 patients who subsequently died, while clinicians identified only 12 of these 19 as being severely ill, based on their clinical assessment. These data suggest a value for the BTS rule to identify high-risk patients in a simple and reliable fashion (<i>Level II evidence</i>).\n</p><p><b>Recommendations for the Admission Decision\n</b></p><p>Prediction rules may oversimplify the way physicians interpret predictor variables, since each variable has a \"threshold\" for being a poor prognostic finding. Thus, in the Pneumonia PORT approach, a patient with a diastolic blood pressure of 56 mm Hg falls into the same stratification as a patient with a diastolic blood pressure of 30 mm Hg, even though the two patients have profoundly different severity of illness. In addition, the Pneumonia PORT rule assigns points in a way that heavily weights age, requiring much more severe physiologic abnormalities in young patients compared with older patients, in order to fall into a risk group requiring admission. Finally, prediction rules neglect the importance of patient preferences in clinical decision-making. This point is highlighted by the observations that the vast majority of low-risk patients with CAP do not have their preferences for site of care solicited, even though many have a strong preference for outpatient care (106).\n</p><p>The committee felt that mortality prediction rules should be used to support, but not replace, physician decision making. Patients may have rare conditions, such as severe neuromuscular disease or prior splenectomy, that are not included as factors in these prediction rules but that increase the likelihood of a poor prognosis. In addition, factors other than severity of illness must be considered, and patients designated as \"low risk\" may have important medical and psychosocial contraindications to outpatient care. Ability to maintain oral intake, history of substance abuse, cognitive impairment, and ability to carry out activities of daily living should be considered (<i>Level III evidence</i>). Thus, determination of the initial site of care remains an \"art of medicine\" decision that cannot be easily made by any of the existing prediction models.\n</p><p><b>DEFINITION OF SEVERE COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA AND NEED FOR ADMISSION TO THE ICU\n</b></p><p>Severe community-acquired pneumonia is an entity described in the literature in reference to patients with CAP admitted to the ICU. The incidence, etiology, prognostic factors, and outcome of these patients have been defined, and differ from those in the overall population of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Studies have shown that patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia have a distinct spectrum of etiologic agents (8, 9, 16) (<i>Level II evidence</i>).\n</p><p>Early recognition of patients with severe CAP will aid in the initiation of prompt therapy directed at the likely etiologic pathogens, a strategy associated with reduced mortality, if it leads to a clinical improvement within 72 h (20). Although there is no uniformly accepted definition of severe CAP, the original ATS guidelines identified nine criteria for severe illness, and the presence of any one was used to define severe CAP. Subsequently, several studies have shown that when only one of these criteria is used, as many as 65-68% of all admitted patients have \"severe CAP,\" indicating that the original definition was overly sensitive, and not specific (48, 57).\n</p><p>cluded a need for mechanical ventilation, an increase in the size of infiltrates by   50% within 48 h, septic shock or the need for pressors for   4 h, and acute renal failure (urine output   80 ml in 4 h or serum creatinine   2 mg/dl in the absence of chronic renal failure). In this retrospective study, the need for ICU admission could be defined by using a rule that required the presence of either two of three minor criteria (systolic BP   90 mm Hg, multilobar disease, PaO2/FIO2 ratio   250) or one of two major criteria (need for mechanical ventilation or septic shock). When the other criteria for severe illness were evaluated, they did not add to the accuracy of predicting the need for ICU admission. With this rule the sensitivity was 78%, the specificity was 94%, the positive predictive value was 75%, and the negative predictive value was 95% (48).\n</p><p><b>Recommended Definition of Severe CAP and Need for ICU Admission\n</b></p><p>Although future prospective studies defining the need for ICU admission are still needed, the committee felt that severe CAP could be defined as the presence of two minor criteria (using only the three listed above or the five in the original ATS statement), or one major criterion (using the two listed above or the four in the original ATS statement) (<i>Level II evidence</i>). Other findings suggesting severe illness may also have utility, but have not been formally tested to define the need for ICU admission. These include the two (of the four) other criteria in the BTS rule (in addition to the two included in the definition of severe CAP), namely confusion and BUN   19.6 mg/dl.\n</p><p><b>TREATMENT GUIDELINES FOR COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA\n</b></p><p><b>Principles Underlying Antibiotic Therapy Recommendations\n</b></p><p>The purpose of these guidelines is to provide the practicing physician with a rational and manageable approach to the <i>initial antimicrobial management</i> of community-acquired pneumonia. By their very nature, these guidelines cannot encompass all eventualities. The approach chosen is a modification of the initial ATS guidelines, and is based, as shown in Tables 2-5, on an assessment of place of therapy (outpatient, hospital ward, or ICU), the presence of coexisting cardiopulmonary disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure), and the presence of modifying factors (Table 1). These modifying factors have been defined from published data and include the presence of risk factors for DRSP (age   65 yr,  -lactam therapy within 3 mo, alcoholism, multiple medical comorbidities, immunosuppressive illness or therapy, and exposure to a child in a day care center), the presence of risk factors for enteric gram-negatives (from a nursing home, underlying cardiopulmonary disease, underlying multiple medical comorbidities, and recent antibiotic therapy), and the presence of risk factors for <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (bronchiectasis, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy for   7 d within the past month, malnutrition, and chronic corticosteroid therapy with   10 mg/d) (8, 52, 68). Patient stratification should be done without viewing age alone (in the absence of comorbid illness) as a predictor of enteric gram-negative infection. Therapy recommendations have incorporated the idea that atypical patho-lected. A less aggressive and narrower spectrum approach can be used for the milder cases, and as host factors become more complex or the severity of illness increases, a more aggressive and broad-spectrum regimen is recommended.\n</p><p>In using this approach, several principles should be considered. First, timing of initial therapy is important, because there are data showing a reduced mortality at 30 d if hospitalized patients receive their first dose of antibiotic therapy within 8 h of arrival at the hospital (77) (<i>Level II evidence</i>). In addition, it is desirable to give as narrow a spectrum of therapy as possible, avoiding excessively broad antibiotic therapy, if it is not needed. This goal is easily achieved if a specific etiologic diagnosis is made, but this is impossible in at least half of all patients, and the results of many diagnostic studies are not immediately available, making relatively broad spectrum empiric therapy a necessity for most patients, initially. Still, on the basis of epidemiologic considerations, even empiric therapy can be relatively narrow spectrum, provided that the patient does not have risk factors for DRSP or enteric gram-negatives (107, 108) (<i>Level I evidence</i>). For all patients, there is value in using initial empiric therapy based on guidelines. This type of approach not only assures timely therapy, but can also provide coverage for the possibility of mixed bacterial and atypical pathogen infection. Data in both outpatients and inpatients have shown that empiric therapy based on the initial ATS guidelines leads to a better outcome than if nonguideline therapy is used (55-57) (<i>Level II evidence</i>).\n</p><p>Several studies have attempted to validate treatment guidelines for CAP, for both outpatients and inpatients. Gleason and coworkers studied outpatients, and documented the value of macrolide monotherapy for patients   age 60 yr and without comorbid illness, but also found that macrolide monother-apy was often effective for older patients with comorbid illness (55). Although this simple therapy, which was not recommended by the guidelines, was effective for some complex outpatients with comorbid illness, the findings did not necessarily negate the need for more broad-spectrum therapy in other outpatients with comorbid illness or advanced age. In the study, the patients who were treated according to the guidelines were few in number and were more severely ill than those treated with nonguideline therapy, and the therapy they received was primarily a  -lactam or trimethoprim/sulfameth-oxizole alone, without the addition of a macrolide as recommended in Table 3 of the current guidelines. Gordon and coworkers examined nearly 4,500 patients admitted to the hospital and not the ICU, and found that therapy according to the guidelines (recommended  -lactam, with or without a macrolide) led to a lower mortality than if nonguideline recommended therapy was used, although the mortality was lowest for the patients who received a macrolide plus a  -lactam (57). In a Medicare study of nearly 13,000 patients, the use of a second- or third-generation cephalosporin with a macrolide (but not alone), or the use of a quinolone (primarily ciproflox-acin), were therapy regimens associated with reduced mortality, compared with all other regimens (56). These findings lend some credence to the potential importance of the role of atypical pathogens, and the need for routine therapy directed at this possibility, either by adding a macrolide to a  -lactam, or by using an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone alone. Dean\nand coworkers documented the value of a care process model based on the ATS guidelines, for providing appropriate antibiotic prescribing advice and for reducing hospital length of stay and cost (109, 109a).\n</p><p><b>Antimicrobial Choices\n</b></p><p>The fluoroquinolones have assumed an important role in the management of CAP because of the development of new agents with excellent antipneumococcal activity. The advantages of the antipneumococcal fluoroquinolones include the ability to cover gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical pathogens with a single agent, generally given once a day (110). In addition, the newer agents have comparable MIC values for pneumococci that are either penicillin sensitive or penicillin resistant, although data have shown that high-level penicillin resistance can be associated with quinolone (cipro-floxacin) resistance (61). Quinolones penetrate well into the lung, often achieving levels higher than serum levels at sites such as the epithelial lining fluid and alveolar macrophages (110). In addition, quinolones are highly bioavailable, achieving similar serum levels with oral therapy as with intravenous therapy. These features allow for certain patients with moderately severe illness to be treated with oral therapy out of the hospital and also may permit the hospitalized patient to switch rapidly from intravenous to oral therapy, allowing for an early hospital discharge. There are some studies showing that admitted patients, even with bacteremia, can be effectively treated with an oral quinolone (111, 112). In spite of these data, it may be prudent to start all admitted patients who receive a quinolone on intravenous therapy to assure adequate blood levels (<i>Level III evidence</i>). Since anywhere from 10 to 20% of admitted patients do not respond to initial therapy (for a variety of reasons discussed below), it may be simpler to evaluate such individuals if there is no likelihood that the nonresponse is the result of a failure to absorb the initial therapy, as could occur if it was administered orally (113, 114). Currently there are a number of new antipneumococcal fluoroquinolones available, or in development, for the therapy of CAP (110). Currently available agents (in addition to cipro-floxacin and ofloxacin) include levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, gat-ifloxacin, and moxifloxacin. Trovafloxacin is restricted globally because concerns about toxicity, and gemifloxacin is in development. Among the available and widely used new agents, only levofloxacin and gatifloxacin are currently available both intravenously and orally, while the other two agents are available only orally, but intravenous formulations of moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin are being developed. Drug-related toxicity has limited the usefulness of some of these agents, with some drugs having more class-related toxicities than others. These include photosensitivity (a particular problem with sparfloxacin) and gastrointestinal upset and neurotoxicity (seizures, lightheadedness). Severe liver toxicity has been reported with trovafloxacin, and as a result its use has been virtually halted. This effect, which can theoretically occur with any quinolone, seems more common with this particular agent, but was not evident in registration trials or in early clinical experience, suggesting the need to monitor all new agents for this possible effect (110, 115) (<i>Level III evidence</i>). Among the currently available agents, the MIC values for pneumococcus vary from 0.12 to 2.0 mg/dl, with the agents having antipneumococcal activity in the following order (most active to least active): moxifloxacin   gatifloxacin   sparflox-acin   levofloxacin (61,110). Gemifloxacin is more active <i>in vitro</i> against <i>S. pneumoniae</i> than moxifloxacin and gatifloxa-cin (61). Differences in the <i>in vitro</i> activity of these agents do not yet appear to have clinical impact, since all approved agents have documented efficacy in CAP (110, 115-117). The differences seen with <i>in vitro</i> activity may lead to different rates of resistance and clinical success in the future, if pneumococcal resistance to these agents becomes more common, but more data are needed.\n</p><p>The CDC has developed recommendations for empiric antibiotic therapy of CAP, if DRSP is likely (60). This statement emphasized the efficacy of older agents for the therapy of CAP, even in the presence of DRSP, and suggested that fluo-roquinolones be considered as second choice agents for CAP, an opinion that the committee did not accept (<i>see below</i>). However, if DRSP is likely, the CDC group has identified a number of active  -lactam agents that can be used for initial empiric therapy, if the organism has a penicillin MIC of   2 mg/L, which include oral therapy with cefuroxime (alternatively cefpodoxime), high-dose amoxicillin (1 g every 8 h), or amoxicillin/clavulanate (875 mg twice daily); intravenous therapy with cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin/sulbactam; or, alternatively, a new antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone could be used (60) (<i>Level II and III evidence</i>). Other agents that are generally active <i>in vitro</i> against these organisms include cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem, and meropenem, but all of these agents are also active against <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, and are not recommended as primary therapy of CAP, since they provide broader coverage than is necessary, unless risk factors for <i>P. aeruginosa</i> are present (severe CAP, and some patients from nursing homes). If pneumococcal MIC values to penicillin are at 4 mg/L or greater, then the committee recommends that therapy should be with a new antipneumococcal fluoro-quinolone, vancomycin, or clindamycin (<i>Level III evidence</i>). At the current time, all of the approved quinolones have efficacy in CAP and one agent, levofloxacin, is approved for CAP due to DRSP. However, in the future, it may be necessary to choose the most active quinolone (lowest pneumococcal MIC values) available, because data show that penicillin-resistant pneumococci can also be resistant to quinolones, particularly those agents with the highest MIC values (ciprofloxacin, levo-floxacin), and preliminary reports of levofloxacin failures for pneumococcal pneumonia have appeared (61, 117, 118).\n</p><p>The committee felt that vancomycin should have a limited role, particularly for empiric therapy (60). If DRSP is suspected, other agents, as listed in Tables 2-5, will be effective, and vancomycin should be reserved for patients with high level resistance who are failing other therapies, or for those with suspected meningitis (<i>Level III evidence</i>). The empiric regimens for hospitalized patients do not specifically target <i>S. aureus</i>, but this pathogen should be considered in patients with CAP following influenza infection, and in those with a compatible sputum Gram's stain. Most of the initial therapy regimens are adequate against methicillin-sensitive <i>S. aureus</i>, and methicillin resistance is not common in CAP, making empiric vancomycin therapy unnecessary. However, in patients with severe CAP, coming from a nursing home known to harbor this organism, empiric vancomycin can be considered as part of initial empiric therapy. Several new therapies may have efficacy for CAP due to DRSP. Linezolid is available intravenously and orally and has efficacy against pneumococcus, including DRSP. The ketolides (the first agent being studied is telithromycin) have good <i>in vitro</i> activity against DRSP and may be an oral therapy option for outpatients at risk for infection with this organism.\n</p><p>Although high rates (up to 61%) of <i>in vitro</i> macrolide resistance can coexist with penicillin resistance, there are few reports of macrolide failures in CAP due to drug-resistant pneumococci and these agents should be effective for organisms with penicillin MIC values of   2.0 mg/L (60a, 119). This may\nbe the result of the high degree of macrolide penetration into respiratory secretions, and other relevant tissue sites of infection. In addition, most macrolide resistance in North America (but not all parts of Europe) is due to an efflux mechanism, and not a ribosomal mechanism, with the efflux mechanism being associated with substantially lower MIC values than the ribosomal mechanism (119). In addition, in the regimens listed in Tables 2-5, macrolides are used alone only in the absence of risks for DRSP and enteric gram-negatives, and if these risks are present, macrolides are used as part of a combination regimen with one of the  -lactams that is highly active against DRSP. There have been case reports of a few patients with macrolide-resistant pneumococcal bacteremia requiring hospitalization after oral therapy with a macrolide, but most of these patients would not have been candidates for macrolide monotherapy, according to the recommendations in Tables 2- 4, and some of these patients received this oral therapy for nonpneumonia indications (119a-119c).\n</p><p>Certain agents that should <i>not</i> be used if DRSP is suspected, because of a possible lack of efficacy, include first-generation cephalosporins, cefaclor, loracarbef, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxizole.\n</p><p><b>Therapy Recommendations\n</b></p><p>In each patient category listed in Tables 2-5, the committee has recommended specific therapy options. In each category, several choices for empiric therapy have been provided, and when possible, the committee recommended a more narrow-spectrum empiric therapy, such as a macrolide alone, particularly if the patient has no risks for DRSP, aspiration, or enteric gram-negatives (107, 108). In Tables 2-5 there are multiple alternative therapies, and if there is no particular order of preference, this is stated in tables. For more complex patients, the scheme usually involves the choice between a  -lactam/mac-rolide combination or monotherapy with a new antipneumo-coccal fluoroquinolone. Clinical studies have shown that either approach is effective and safe, and it is unclear that there is an advantage to choosing one regimen over another (<i>Level II evidence</i>). The members of the consensus panel recommend that when choosing between these options, physicians consider using both approaches in different patients, in order to avoid the selection pressure for resistance that would follow from using one antibiotic approach for all patients. This recommendation (<i>Level III evidence</i>) has not been tested and needs further study.\n</p><p><i>Outpatient therapy</i>. If the patient has no cardiopulmonary disease, and no risks for DRSP, aspiration, or enteric gram-negatives, then the likely organisms will be pneumococcus, atypical pathogens, respiratory viruses, and possibly <i>H. influ-enzae</i> (especially in cigarette smokers). For these patients (Group I, Table 2) therapy should be with an advanced generation macrolide, with doxycycline as a second choice (because of less reliable activity against pneumococcus) for patients who are allergic or intolerant of macrolides. The committee felt that broader spectrum coverage with a new antipneumo-coccal fluoroquinolone would be effective, but unnecessary, and if used in this setting could promote overusage of this valuable class of antibiotics (<i>Level III evidence</i>). If <i>H. influen-\n</i></p><p><i>zae</i> is not likely, because the patient is a nonsmoker without cardiopulmonary disease, any macrolide could be used, including erythromycin. However, the advanced generation mac-rolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin) have a lower incidence of gastrointestinal side effects than erythromycin and are administered less frequently (once or twice daily) than erythromycin, improving the likelihood of patient compliance with therapy (120). Although clarithromycin is not as active <i>in vitro\n</i>against <i>H. influenzae</i> as azithromycin, clinical experience with both azithromycin and clarithromycin in CAP has been favorable. This may be explained by the excellent concentrations of macrolides achieved in the epithelilal lining fluid and alveolar macrophages, and by the predominance of the efflux mechanism of pneumococcal resistance in North America.\n</p><p>The more complex outpatient (Group II, Table 3) can be managed with either a  -lactam/macrolide combination or monotherapy with an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone (<i>Level II evidence</i>). Doxycycline can be used, along with a  -lactam, as an alternative to a macrolide for these patients. For many patients, the ease of using one drug once daily will make the quinolone option more appealing, and in some instances less expensive. The oral  -lactam should be one of the agents that is likely to be effective if DRSP is present (listed in Table 3 and above), and the agent should be used in an adequate dose, as discussed above. If ampicillin is used, it does not provide adequate coverage of <i>H. influenzae</i>, and thus should be combined with either an advanced generation macrolide (not erythromycin) or doxycycline. One  -lactam option that can be used is parenteral (intravenous or intramuscular) once-daily ceftriaxone along with a macrolide or doxycycline. The parenteral  -lactam can be switched to oral therapy after 1-2 d, provided the patient is showing an appropriate clinical response. If the patient has aspiration risk factors, or is living in a nursing home, anaerobes should be covered and this can be achieved with amoxicillin/clavulanate or amoxicillin (still combined with a macrolide). If anaerobes are documented, or if a lung abscess is present, clindamycin or metronidazole should be incorporated into the therapy regimen.\n</p><p><i>Inpatient therapy</i>. For the admitted patient with cardiopulmonary disease, and/or risk factors for DRSP or enteric gram-negatives, therapy can be with either a  -lactam/macrolide combination or monotherapy with an antipneumococcal fluo-roquinolone (Group IIIa, Table 4a) (<i>Level II evidence</i>). If risks for DRSP are present, the  -lactam should be one of the selected agents listed above. When a  -lactam is used in these patients, it is not used alone, but combined with a macrolide to provide coverage for atypical pathogen infection (<i>Level II evidence</i>). The macrolide can be given either orally or intravenously, depending on the severity of illness of the patient (121). Doxycycline can be used for the patient who is allergic or intolerant to macrolides. If the patient has risk factors for aspiration, or is living in a nursing home, anaerobes should be covered by using either ampicillin/sulbactam, high-dose ampicillin, or other active  -lactams. For the admitted patient, if anaerobes are documented, or if a lung abscess is present, clin-damycin or metronidazole should be added to the regimen. For the admitted patient not in the ICU, without risks for DRSP or enteric gram-negatives and without cardiopulmonary disease (Group IIIb, Table 4b), there are data to suggest the efficacy of intravenous azithromycin alone; however, few admitted patients are likely to fall into this category (<i>Level II evidence</i>). The dose of intravenous azithromycin is 500 mg daily for 2-5 d, followed by oral therapy at 500 mg daily for a total of 7-10 d, and this therapy has been effective for admitted patients with CAP, including those with pneumococcal bacteremia (107, 108). If the patient is macrolide allergic or intolerant, then therapy should be with doxycycline and a  -lactam, or with an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone alone. Although one study has reported that doxycycline is a cost-effective monotherapy for admitted patients with CAP (122), the study has many limitations, and the committee did not feel that this monotherapy option should be used. In addition, there was concern that with widespread use, pneumococcal resistance could emerge more rapidly to doxycycline than to\nother agents, and the photosensitivity associated with this agent may limit its use in some geographic areas.\n</p><p>For the patient with severe illness, therapy should be directed against pneumococcus, <i>Legionella</i> (and other atypi-cals), and <i>H. influenzae</i>, but patients should be stratified on the basis of whether risks for <i>P. aeruginosa</i> are absent or present (Group IVa, Table 5a; and Group IVb, Table 5b) (<i>Level III evidence</i>). In the absence of pseudomonal risk factors, therapy should be with a  -lactam that would be active against DRSP plus either azithromycin or a quinolone (Group IVa, Table 5a). Erythromycin was not recommended for this group because of difficulties in administration and tolerance. When a  -lactam is used in this population (Group IVa, Table 5a) and in the patients included in Group IIIa, (Table 4a), the agent should be active against DRSP, but agents that are also active against <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (cefepime, piperacillin/tazobac-tam, imipenem, meropenem) are not recommended as primary therapy when this organism is not suspected (<i>Level III evidence</i>). The role of antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone mono-therapy in severe CAP is currently uncertain. The published clinical trials have generally involved few patients admitted to the ICU, and the proper dosing and efficacy of the new quino-lones for severe CAP is unknown. There are data with cipro-floxacin (400 mg every 8 h) showing efficacy in severe CAP, but the number of patients studied is small (123). Until more data become available, the committee suggests that if quinolo-nes are used for severe CAP, they be used as a replacement for a macrolide, and be part of a combination regimen, usually with a  -lactam (<i>Level III evidence</i>). The addition of a  -lactam will also assure adequate therapy of pneumonia complicated by meningitis, since the efficacy of quinolone monother-apy in this setting is unknown. If pseudomonal risk factors are present (Group IVb, Table 5b), therapy should include two antipseudomonal agents, and provide coverage for DRSP and\n<i>Legionella</i>. This can be done with selected  -lactams (cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem, meropenem) plus an an-tipseudomonal quinolone (ciprofloxacin), or with selected  -lactams plus an aminoglycoside and either azithromycin or a nonpseudomonal quinolone (<i>Level III evidence</i>). If the patient is at risk for <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and is also  -lactam allergic, aztre-onam can be used in place of the  -lactams listed above, and should be combined with a regimen that includes an aminogly-coside and an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone.\n</p><p><b>DURATION OF THERAPY, RESPONSE TO THERAPY, AND SWITCH TO ORAL THERAPY\n</b></p><p><b>Duration of Treatment\n</b></p><p>Surprisingly few data exist to define the optimal duration of therapy for CAP and standard textbooks provide little specific referenced information about this issue. In the past, standard therapy has been 7-14 d, but new agents with a long serum or tissue half-life have been developed, which shorten the duration of drug administration. Clinical trials are being conducted with old and new agents to examine the optimal duration of therapy in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Studies are being designed to examine courses of therapy for 5-7 d among outpatients, and for 7-10 d for inpatients (124). Short treatment courses may also be possible with the 15-member mac-rolide, azithromycin. This agent has a half-life of 11 to 14 h, compared with 1.5 to 3 and 3.8 h for erythromycin and clarithromycin, respectively (120). Azithromycin remains in the tissues longer than most agents, so that reduced length of treatment based on the number of days of oral ingestion of the drug is misleading. Trials comparing oral azithromycin for 5 d with erythromycin and with cefaclor for 10 d in the treatment of pneumonia due to \"atypical pathogens\" and bacterial pathogens, respectively, suggest that shorter courses with this agent may be used (125, 126). Trials of intravenous azithromy-cin in CAP have reported a duration of therapy of 7-10 d, while 7 d of therapy may be possible with some of the new an-tipneumococcal fluoroquinolones (107, 108, 110, 116, 117).\n<i>Recommendations</i>. The presence of coexisting illness and/ or bacteremia, the severity of illness at the onset of antibiotic therapy, and the subsequent hospital course should be considered in determining the duration of antibiotic therapy. Generally, <i>S. pneumoniae</i> pneumonia, and other bacterial infections, should be treated for 7 to 10 d, and there are no data showing that a longer duration of therapy is needed for bacteremic patients, provided that the patient has had a good clinical response. Patients with <i>M. pneumoniae</i> and <i>C. pneumoniae</i> may need longer therapy ranging from 10 to 14 d. Immunocompetent patients with Legionnaire's disease should receive treatment for 10-14 d, whereas patients chronically treated with corticosteroids may require 14 d, or longer, of therapy (<i>Level III evidence</i>).\n</p><p><b>Expected Clinical Course and Response to Therapy\n</b></p><p>Duration of therapy and the early switch to oral therapy for hospitalized patients are decisions that are based on patients responding to therapy in an expected and appropriate fashion. Failure to respond as expected should lead to other diagnostic and therapeutic considerations (<i>see below</i>). The expected response of the hospitalized patient with CAP falls into three different periods: the first, starting with the initiation of appropriate parenteral therapy, lasts 24-72 h and during this time the patient becomes progressively more clinically stable; the second period typically starts by Day 3, with the patient having clinical stability demonstrated by improvement in signs, symptoms, and laboratory values; the third period is one of recovery and resolution of abnormal findings. Delay in the onset of clinical improvement can result from host or pathogen factors, and at any point clinical deterioration can occur. In general, with increasing patient age, multiple coexisting illnesses, and increasing severity of disease, the resolution of clinical signs and symptoms will be delayed (<i>Level II evidence</i>) (127-133). Other factors associated with delayed resolution include alcoholism, multilobar pneumonia, and bacteremia (127,128). Clinical deterioration usually occurs early, within the first 3 d, and a pattern of improvement and then deterioration is unusual and often the result of deep-seated infection (empyema) or an intercurrent process.\n</p><p>In individuals who are otherwise healthy, fever can last for 2-4 d, with defervescence occurring most rapidly with <i>S. pneu-moniae</i> infection, and slower with other etiologies (21, 129, 130). Leukocytosis usually resolves by Day 4, while abnormal physical findings (crackles) persist beyond 7 d in 20-40% of patients. Abnormal findings on chest radiograph clear more slowly than do clinical signs of pneumonia. For those less than 50 yr old, and otherwise healthy, <i>S. pneumoniae</i> pneumonia will clear radiographically by 4 wk in only 60% of patients (128,131). If the patient is older, has bacteremic pneumonia, COPD, alcoholism, or underlying chronic illness, radiographic clearing is even slower, and only 25% will have a normal radiograph at 4 wk (131). <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> infection can clear radiographically more rapidly than pneumococcal infection, while pneumonia due to <i>Legionella</i> sp. will clear more slowly (94).\n</p><p>The radiograph often worsens initially after therapy is started, with progression of the infiltrate and/or development of a pleural effusion. If the patient has mild or moderate pneumonia or is showing an otherwise good clinical response, this\nradiographic progression may have no significance. However, radiographic deterioration in the setting of severe community-acquired pneumonia has been noted to be a particularly poor prognostic feature, highly predictive of mortality (8).\n<i>Recommendations for management based on clinical response</i>. On the basis of the clinical response to therapy, patients may be categorized into three groups: (<i>1</i>) patients with early clinical response; (<i>2</i>) patients with lack of clinical response, which should be defined at Day 3 of hospitalization; and (<i>3</i>) patients with clinical deterioration, which can occur as early as after 24-48 h of therapy. Those falling in the first category should be considered for rapid switch to oral therapy, followed by prompt hospital discharge (<i>Level II evidence</i>). Patients in the second and third categories need an evaluation of host and pathogen factors, along with a reevaluation of the initial diagnosis and a search for complications of pneumonia and pneumonia therapy (<i>see below</i>). Because of the natural course of treatment response, antibiotic therapy should not be changed within the first 72 h, unless there is marked clinical deterioration or if bacteriologic data necessitate a change (<i>Level III evidence</i>) (132, 132a). In the setting of severe pneumonia, radiographic deterioration, along with accompanying clinical deterioration, may signify inadequately treated infection, and thus aggressive evaluation and a change in antimicrobial therapy may be necessary, even before 72 h of therapy has elapsed (<i>Level III evidence</i>).\n</p><p><b>When to Consider Switch to Oral Therapy\n</b></p><p>The decision to switch from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy is based on an assessment of clinical response, evaluating symptoms of cough, sputum production, dyspnea, fever, and leukocytosis. Once the patient has clinically stabilized, switch to oral therapy can be achieved, and up to half of all patients are eligible on hospital Day 3 (132). Some studies have shown that early switch to oral therapy can reduce hospital length of stay, and may even improve outcome, compared with prolonged intravenous therapy (132, 132a). If the patient meets appropriate criteria for switch therapy, oral antibiotics can be started, even if the patient had a positive blood culture (133). Bacteremic patients may take longer to meet criteria for switch therapy than nonbacteremic patients, but once criteria are met the switch can be safely accomplished, unless the organism is <i>S. aureus</i>, in which case the patients need a longer duration of therapy to prevent or treat endocarditis.\n</p><p>Another issue to consider is whether it is necessary to maintain the same drug levels with oral therapy as were achieved with intravenous therapy. Agents that achieve comparable serum levels either intravenously or orally, defined as \"sequential\" therapy, include doxycycline, linezolid, and most quinolones (120). With the  -lactams (penicillin, cephalosporins) and macrolides, the switch to oral therapy is associated with a decrease in serum levels, compared with intravenous therapy, and this is defined as \"step-down\" therapy. Good clinical success has been documented with either a sequential or a step-down approach (124, 132).\n</p><p><i>Recommendations</i>. Patients should be switched to oral therapy if they meet four criteria: improvement in cough and dyspnea, afebrile (  100  F) on two occasions 8 h apart, white blood cell count decreasing, functioning gastrointestinal tract with adequate oral intake (132, 132a). However, if the overall clinical response is otherwise favorable, it may not be necessary to wait until the patient is afebrile before making the switch to oral therapy (<i>Level II evidence</i>) (132a, 133). In selecting an oral antibiotic for switch therapy, a specific agent, based on organism sensitivity patterns, can be chosen if the etiologic pathogen is known. In this instance the narrowest spectrum agent with an appropriate pharmacokinetic profile should be chosen; however, the issue of possible atypical pathogen coinfection should be considered. In most instances, a specific pathogen is not identified and the oral therapy should continue the spectrum of the intravenous agents used (<i>Level III evidence</i>). Compliance is a key issue with oral therapy and thus agents should be chosen with a minimum of side effects, and with dosing either once or twice daily, factors that increase the likelihood that the patient will complete a full course of therapy (134). Patients should also be instructed to avoid potential drug-drug interactions and to avoid antacids and certain foods that could interfere with drug absorption.\n</p><p><b>Hospital Discharge\n</b></p><p>Patients who reach clinical stability for their pneumonia and are switched to oral therapy may still require hospitalization because of unstable coexisting illnesses, such as diabetes or congestive heart failure. Patients may also need therapy for life-threatening complications such as cardiac arrhythmia, and for management of social needs, such as an unstable home situation (135, 136).\n</p><p>A repeat chest radiograph early in the hospital stay is unlikely to show marked improvement, even if the patient has a good clinical response. Some patients may have an abnormal chest radiograph due to slow radiographic clearing, without clinical significance, but radiographs should be followed until a new stable baseline is achieved (128). An evaluation is needed if the chest radiograph fails to return to normal, especially in a patient without complete resolution of clinical signs and symptoms (138).\n</p><p><i>Recommendations</i>. In the absence of any unstable coexisting illnesses, or other life-threatening complications, the patient should be discharged home the same day that clinical stability occurs and oral therapy is initiated. In-hospital observation on oral therapy is not necessary, and only adds to cost and length of stay, without any measurable clinical benefit (<i>Level II evidence</i>) (132a, 136). There is no need to repeat a chest radiograph prior to hospital discharge in a patient who is clinically improving. A repeat radiograph is recommended during a follow-up office visit, approximately 4 to 6 wk after hospital discharge, to establish a new radiographic baseline and to exclude the possibility of malignancy associated with CAP, particularly in older smokers (128, 137) (<i>Level III evidence</i>).\n</p><p><b>MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WHO DO NOT RESPOND ADEQUATELY TO INITIAL THERAPY\n</b></p><p>If the patient's clinical findings are not improving or are deteriorating after initial empiric therapy, consideration must be given to several possible causes. If the patient is not clinically stable by Day 3, and if host factors associated with a delayed response are present, continued therapy, without an antibiotic change, is appropriate. If, however, the patient has no explanation for a slow response, if there is no response after 7 d of therapy, or if there is clinical deterioration after 24 h of therapy, a careful re-evaluation to identify treatable causes is necessary (<i>Level III evidence</i>). The common etiologies for clinical deterioration fall into the following four categories.\n</p><p><b>Inadequate Antimicrobial Selection\n</b></p><p>The etiologic organism may be resistant to the drug(s) used in the initial empiric regimen (i.e., not covered by the initial antibiotic therapy). For example, the therapies outlined above are not optimal for <i>S. aureus</i>, and an aggressive search for this pathogen should be undertaken in the patient who worsens on the above-described regimens. Although empiric therapy for\n</p><p>DRSP is recommended only for patients with risk factors, it is possible for a patient without identified risk factors to be infected with DRSP and fail to respond to empiric therapy with a recommended regimen. If the patient has risk factors for <i>P. aeruginosa</i>, this organism may fail to respond to a recommended empiric therapy regimen. Alternatively, the infection could be caused by an agent that is not responsive to antimicrobials of any type (i.e., a virus). Another possible explanation is that the responsible pathogen was initially sensitive to the antibiotics used, but has now become resistant, and thus organism sensitivities on both the initial (if obtained) and repeat sputum cultures should be checked.\n</p><p><b>Unusual Pathogens\n</b></p><p>An additional consideration is that the patient may have community-acquired pneumonia caused by an unusual organism. Such infections should be considered when clinical and radiographic findings persist (chronic pneumonia), and the differential diagnosis includes tuberculosis, endemic fungal pneumonia (such as coccidioidomycosis), and <i>P. carinii</i> pneumonia. In addition, some patients may have a \"relapsing\" pneumonia, which appears to improve and then deteriorates. This situation should lead to consideration of unusual pathogens, including tuberculosis and nocardiosis. Although a discussion of the immunocompromised and/or HIV-infected patient is not included in this statement, it is possible that a patient will have one of these conditions, even though this was not initially suspected. Patients who receive corticosteroids have been reported to develop community-acquired fungal pneumonia (139).\n</p><p>A careful repeat of the history is essential in the patient who is not improving, and certain epidemiological clues related to animal exposures and travel may suggest specific pathogens that can be detected with special serologies or cultures (Table 6). Q fever (<i>C. burnetii</i>) may follow exposure to parturient cats, cattle, sheep, or goats. Tularemia can occur with exposure to infected rabbits, and ticks. Psittacosis may occur after exposure to avian sources of infection; and plague or leptospirosis can follow exposure to rats. Anaerobes due to aspiration should be considered if the patient has a history of alcoholism, injection drug use, nursing home residency, neurologic illness, or any other cause of impaired consciousness. Travel to Southeast Asia can be complicated by infection with <i>Burkholderia</i> (<i>Pseudomonas</i>) <i>pseudomallei</i>, while Paragonimiasis can be acquired in Asia, Africa, or Central and South America. A history of tuberculosis exposure and prior tuberculin skin test status should also be elicited. If the skin test for tuberculosis has not been done and the patient is in an epidemiological risk group, it should be applied, and sputum collected for tuberculosis staining and culture. Other unusual pathogens that can lead to a syndrome of CAP include mycobacteria other than tuberculosis, endemic fungi (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis), <i>Pasteurella multocida</i>, <i>Bacillus anthracis</i>, <i>Actinomyces israeli</i>, <i>Francisella tularensis</i>, <i>Leptospira</i> spp., Nocardia spp, <i>Rhodococcus equi</i>, <i>Yersinia pestis</i> (plague), and hantavirus.\n</p><p><b>Complications of Pneumonia\n</b></p><p>In addition to the diagnoses considered above, the patient who remains ill in spite of empiric therapy may have extrapulmo-nary complications of pneumonia. Up to 10% of patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia can have metastatic infections, which include meningitis, arthritis, endocarditis, pericarditis, peritonitis, and empyema (140). Particularly because of concern about empyema, any patient with an inadequate clinical response to therapy should have a repeat chest radiograph, and possibly a CT scan, and any pleural fluid should be sampled, cultured, and analyzed for cell count and chemistry. A CT scan can also support the diagnosis of the presence of a lung abscess, which can complicate certain forms of pneumonia. A spinal fluid examination or echocardiogram may be necessary to rule out meningitis or endocarditis. In addition to metastatic infection, several noninfectious extrapulmonary complications of pneumonia can delay radiographic clearing. These include renal failure, heart failure, pulmonary embolus with infarction, and acute myocardial infarction. Finally, if the patient has developed severe sepsis from pneumonia, the chest radiograph and clinical course may deteriorate because of the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple system organ failure. A late complication of CAP, nosocomial pneumonia, can also complicate the illness and lead to an apparent nonresponse to therapy.\n</p><p><b>Noninfectious Illness\n</b></p><p>A final consideration is the group of noninfectious diseases that can mimic pneumonia and initially be misdiagnosed as infection. These include pulmonary embolus, congestive heart failure, obstructing bronchogenic carcinoma, lymphoma, in-trapulmonary hemorrhage, and certain inflammatory lung diseases (bronchiolitis obliterans and organizing pneumonia, Wegener's granulomatosis, sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, acute interstitial pneumonitis, drug-induced lung disease, and eosinophilic pneumonia).\n</p><p><b>Evaluation and Testing\n</b></p><p>When a patient is not improving after initial empiric therapy, it is necessary to consider the value of certain tests for a patient who is already taking antibiotics. For example, nonresponse while receiving antibiotic therapy may indicate the possibility that a resistant, or superinfecting, pathogen is present. However, antibiotics can also decrease the utility of invasive diagnostic methods such as bronchoscopy, which has a high false-negative rate when performed while the patient is receiving antibiotics, although if organisms are recovered by this method, they are often resistant to current antibiotic therapy (141).\n</p><p>One study examined the utility of bronchoscopy in patients who failed empiric therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (142). Therapeutic failures were defined as early (no clinical response within 72 h) or late (initial improvement, but deterioration after 72 h). The incidence of such failures was relatively low, 6.5% of 277 patients having early failure, and 7% having late failure. Bronchoscopy was done when failure occurred, and provided diagnostically useful information in 41% of cases. Bronchoscopy, even in the presence of antibiotics, led to such diagnoses as <i>Legionella</i> sp. infection, anaerobic pneumonia, infection with resistant or unusual pathogens, and tuberculosis. In addition, bronchoscopy can diagnose other infections, including those caused by fungi and <i>P. carinii</i>, and it may be useful in detecting mechanical factors that are delaying resolution, such as an aspirated, obstructing foreign body or an obstructing endobron-chial lesion. Another study evaluated the utility of bronchoscopy in patients with persistent radiographic and clinical abnormalities (138). In that study, bronchoscopy did yield specific diagnoses, but this occurred primarily in nonsmoking patients, less than age 55 yr, who had multilobar infiltrates of long duration. Those who were older, those who have smoked, and those with focal infiltrates had a much lower yield of a specific diagnosis (other than slowly resolving pneumonia) with fiberoptic bronchoscopy.\n</p><p>An open lung biopsy is most useful for defining noninfectious processes in the immunocompetent patient, but may also detect tuberculosis, fungal infections, and other infectious causes. Fortunately, in the setting of CAP, open lung biopsy is rarely needed, and in one study was shown to generally provide little information to improve patient outcome (143).\n</p><p><b>Recommendations for Evaluating the Nonresponding Patient </b></p><p>Bronchoscopy is usually not needed, and patience is necessary to observe the full course of radiographic clearing of community-acquired pneumonia (<i>Level III evidence</i>). However, bronchoscopy should be considered in patients below the age of 55 yr, who have multilobar disease and are nonsmokers. If bronchoscopy is performed, the goal is to identify unusual organisms or drug-resistant pathogens, but the clinician could also obtain this information by collecting lower respiratory tract secretions (sputum or endotracheal aspirate) for culture. Cultures should be sent to evaluate for drug-resistant and unusual pathogens, including tuberculosis.\n</p><p>In addition to sampling lower respiratory tract secretions, other tests should be considered. Computed tomography may reveal unsuspected collections of pleural fluid, multiple lung nodules, or cavitation within a lung infiltrate. Lung scanning, spiral CT scanning, and/or pulmonary angiography should be considered if the patient is at risk for pulmonary embolus with infarction. While the routine use of serologic testing is not useful in the initial evaluation of patients with community-acquired pneumonia, serologic tests for <i>Legionella</i> sp., <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i>, viral agents, endemic fungi, and other unusual pathogens should be considered at this point. <i>Le-gionella</i> urinary antigen testing should also be considered. This test is positive in more than half of all patients with proven <i>Le-gionella pneumophila</i> infection, and more than 80% of patients with <i>Legionella pneumophila</i> serogroup 1 infection (81, 82).\n</p><p>If this extensive diagnostic evaluation has not been useful, and if the patient is seriously ill, open lung biopsy of an involved area of lung should be considered (<i>Level III evidence</i>).\n</p><p><b>VACCINATION RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE PATIENT AT RISK FOR COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA\n</b></p><p>Appropriate patients at risk for CAP should be vaccinated with both pneumococcal and influenza vaccine, both of which have been shown to be safe and effective (<i>Level I and II evidence</i>). Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for pneumonia, and smoking cessation, particularly in patients who have had pneumonia, remains an important preventive strategy for CAP.\n</p><p><b>Pneumococcal Vaccine\n</b></p><p>The current vaccine contains the purified capsular polysaccharide from the 23 serotypes that cause 85-90% of the invasive pneumococcal infections in adults and children in the United States (144). Both Pneumovax and PneuImmune are effective in preventing invasive illness (bacteremia, meningitis, or infection of other normally sterile sites) caused by the included serotypes. The vaccine is both cost-effective and potentially cost saving among individuals over the age of 65 yr for the prevention of bacteremia (145, 146). Efficacy has been inconsistently demonstrated in placebo-controlled trials in patients with chronic illness, but the case-control methodology has documented effectiveness in the range of 56-81% (147-149). Efficacy has also been documented by serotype prevalence studies for bacteremic illness, but not for nonbacteremic pneumonia. The benefits of vaccination have been shown in specific patient groups, and have ranged from 65 to 84% effectiveness in such populations as persons with diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary disease, and anatomic as-plenia (148, 149). In immunocompetent patients over the age of 65 yr, effectiveness has been documented to be 75%. In the immunocompromised patient, effectiveness has not been proven, and this includes patients with sickle cell disease, chronic renal failure, immunoglobulin deficiency, Hodgkin's disease, lymphoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma (148, 149).\n</p><p>The vaccine in its current form leads to an antibody response that declines over 5-10 yr. When the vaccine is given, approximately half of all patients develop mild, local side effects such as pain at the injection site, erythema, and swelling, which last for less than 48 h. Moderate systemic reactions such as fever and myalgia are uncommon, as are more severe local reactions (local induration). No episodes of neurologic illness (Guillain-Barré syndrome) have been reported with the vaccine. A transient increase in HIV replication, of unknown significance, can occur after vaccination in HIV-infected persons. A new conjugated polysaccharide vaccine has been licensed for children. It induces a T cell-dependent response that leads to more prolonged immunologic memory.\n</p><p><i>Recommendations for use</i>. All immune-competent patients aged 65 yr or greater should be immunized (149, 150). Persons age 64 yr or less should be immunized if they have chronic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease (congestive heart failure), chronic pulmonary disease (COPD, but not asthma), diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, chronic liver disease (cirrhosis), cerebrospinal fluid leaks, and functional or anatomic asplenia; or if they are living in special environments or social settings (Alaskan natives, certain American Indian populations, those in long-term care facilities) (<i>Level II evidence</i>). To facilitate these recommendations, persons over age 50 yr should have their vaccination status and risk factors reviewed when they see their primary care physician.\n</p><p>The efficacy in immunosuppressed patients is less certain, although we recommend that vaccination be given to these populations, which include persons with HIV infection, leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, generalized malignancy, chronic renal failure, or nephrotic syndrome, and persons receiving immunosuppressive therapy (including long-term steroids). If immunosuppressive therapy is being contemplated, vaccination should be given at least 2 wk before, if possible.\n</p><p>A single revaccination is indicated in a person who is age   65 yr who initially received the vaccine   5 yr earlier and was   age 65 yr of age on first vaccination. If the initial vaccination was given at age 65 yr or older, a repeat is not indicated. If the patient has anatomic or functional asplenia, revaccination is indicated if the patient is   10 yr of age and the second dose is given at least 5 yr after the original dose. In the immunocompromised patient populations listed above, a repeat vaccination after 5 yr is also indicated.\n</p><p>To improve the rate of vaccination, evaluation of candidates should occur in health care provider offices, in outpatient clinics, and in the hospital prior to discharge for virtually any medical illness. Hospital-based immunization for most admitted patients could be highly effective, since more than 60% of all patients with CAP have been admitted to the hospital, for some indication, in the preceding 4 yr, and hospitalization could be defined as an appropriate time for vaccination (151, 152) (<i>Level III evidence</i>). Pneumococcal vaccine can be given simultaneously with other vaccines such as influenza vaccine, but each should be given at a separate site.\n</p><p>The Health Care Financing Agency has approved the use of standing orders to give the vaccine to Medicare patients, and roster billing has been authorized since August 1996. The codes used for vaccination include V03.82, the diagnostic code for <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>; 90732, the CPT code for pneumococcal vaccination; and G0009, the HCPCS Level II code for administering pneumococal vaccination. The newly licensed protein-conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (Prenevar) contains only seven serotypes. It is protective against most of the serotypes that cause otitis media, pneumonia, and meningitis in children. It is now universally recommended for\nhealthy children beginning at age 2 mo (152a). It has not been adequately tested in adults. The older polysaccharide vaccine can be used in at-risk children beginning at 2 yr of age.\n</p><p><b>Influenza Vaccine\n</b></p><p>Influenza occurs in epidemic fashion, and between 1972 and 1992 there have been   20,000 influenza-associated deaths in each of nine epidemics (153). During the same period, four of these epidemics resulted in   40,000 influenza-associated deaths. The influenza vaccine is modified annually to reflect the anticipated strains in the upcoming season, and the current vaccine contains three strains of virus: an influenza A strain (H3N2), an influenza A strain (H1N1), and an influenza B strain. The vaccine virus is grown in eggs, purified, and then inactivated, so that it is noninfectious and cannot lead to clinical infection. In adults the vaccine can be a split virus vaccine (subvirion and purified surface antigens) or a whole virus vaccine. The current manufacturers are Connaught Laboratories, Evans Medical, and Wyeth Ayerst.\n</p><p>The vaccine has been shown to be effective in preventing or attenuating illness in the elderly and in younger individuals, with efficacy depending on the match between the vaccine strain and the circulating strain (154-156). When the match is good, the vaccine can prevent illness in 70-90% of healthy persons aged   65 yr. For elderly persons with certain chronic illnesses, the efficacy is less, but the vaccine can still attenuate the influenza infection, leading to less frequent lower respiratory infections and the associated morbidity and mortality that follow influenza infection. Although the vaccine is less effective for older persons than for younger persons, it can prevent severe illness and death. In one meta-analysis of 20 studies, the vaccine was shown to reduce the occurrence of pneumonia by 53%, hospitalization by 50%, and mortality by 68% (154). In addition, the vaccine has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality during influenza season by 27-54% (155, 156), and has been shown to be cost-effective in multiple studies (156). Concern about side effects has limited the use of the vaccine by some patients, but the vaccine does not contain live virus and cannot lead to influenza. Reactions include local soreness at the injection site, which may last up to 2 d, and is generally mild and not disabling; systemic symptoms of fever, malaise, and myalgias beginning 6-12 h after vaccination and lasting for 1-2 d, which are not more common than with placebo (157); rare immediate allergic reactions in patients with egg hypersensitivity; and Guillain-Barré syndrome, which has been clearly associated only with the 1976 swine influenza vaccine and has not been associated with other vaccines since then (158).\n</p><p><i>Recommendations for use</i>. Target groups include those at increased risk for influenza complications, those who can transmit influenza to high-risk patients, and other special groups including any person who wishes to reduce the chance of becoming infected with influenza (159) (<i>Level I evidence</i>). Groups at increased risk for influenza-related complications are persons   65 yr, residents of nursing homes or chronic care facilities, patients with chronic pulmonary or cardiovascular disease, those who required regular medical care or hospitalization in the preceding year (for diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, hemoglobinopathies, or immunosuppression), and pregnant women in the second or third trimester during influenza season.\n</p><p>Those who can transmit the illness to high-risk individuals include physicians, nurses, and other personnel in the hospital or outpatient setting; employees of nursing homes and chronic care facilities; home care providers for high-risk patients, and household members of patients in the above high risk groups. Other special groups who should consider vaccination include persons with HIV infection, breast-feeding mothers, travelers to foreign countries during influenza epidemics, those who provide essential community services, and persons who study or work in institutional settings.\n</p><p>Since the relevant viral strain changes annually, revaccination is needed yearly, and should be given from the beginning of September through mid-November. Vaccination can be cost-effective if given to at-risk individuals during hospitalization or during routine health care, before the influenza season. Roster billing can be used in the hospital or in physician's offices, and the following billing codes can be used: V04.8, the diagnostic code for influenza virus; 90724, the CPT code for influenza virus vaccine; and G0008, the HCPCS Level II code for administering influenza virus vaccine. Vaccine programs can facilitate delivery of the vaccine and should be developed in outpatient clinics, emergency rooms, and walk-in clinics, nursing homes, outpatient facilities providing care to high-risk patients (dialysis centers), home care programs, traveler's clinics, and other health care facilities.\n</p><p>A new, live attenuated virus vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective in children as well as healthy working adults.\n</p><p><b>Antiviral Therapy and Chemoprophylaxis\n</b></p><p>The older available antiviral agents (amantadine and rimanta-dine) are active against influenza A virus, but not influenza B virus, while the new neuraminidase inhibitors-zanamivir and os-eltamivir-are active against both influenza A and B (160-162). Amantadine and rimantadine can be given as therapy for influenza and can reduce the severity and duration of illness if administered within 48 h of the onset of symptoms, but their impact on preventing influenza-related complications in high-risk patients is uncertain. These agents can be used during an institutional outbreak of influenza to treat infected persons and to serve as prophylaxis for unvaccinated individuals, and therapy is continued for 1 wk after the end of the outbreak. Antiviral prophylaxis is 70-90% effective against influenza A virus, using either amantadine or rimantadine for the duration of the epidemic in the community (160). Targets for prophylaxis are high-risk patients who have been vaccinated after the onset of the epidemic (they are treated for 2 wk only); persons caring for high-risk patients; persons with immune deficiency; persons in whom the vaccine is contraindicated; and others desiring prophylaxis of influenza A illness.\n</p><p>Adverse reactions to amantadine include central nervous system effects (nervousness, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, lightheadedness), and gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, anorexia). The incidence of central nervous system side effects is less with rimantadine. Dosage should be adjusted for age and renal function and resistance to these agents by influenza A strains has been reported (160).\n</p><p>The antineuraminidase drugs, when used for treating influenza, reduce clinical illness and viral shedding by 2 d (161, 162). Their benefit is greatest when the respiratory illness is most severe. They prevent secondary complications of influenza, such as otitis media and sinusitis. They are effective for prophylaxis against both influenza A and B. Zanamivir is inhaled through the mouth with a specially provided applicator, and bronchospasm is possible, but unusual. Oseltamivir is given as a pill, is rapidly absorbed and achieves high blood levels, and is well tolerated but may lead to occasional nausea, which is prevented by taking the pill with food.\n</p><p>Comparison of the two anti-influenza drug classes shows important differences. With the antimembrane drugs (amantadine and rimantadine), resistance emerges rapidly, frequency of resistance is high, and mutant viruses are common. Neurologic\nside effects are often seen with these agents. With the neuraminidase inhibitors, resistance emerges slowly, the frequency of resistance is low, and the mutant virus had reduced virulence. In addition, neurologic side effects have not been reported. It is likely that the antineuraminidase drugs will be used more widely than the older antiviral agents, and these agents have been shown to be effective not only for prophylaxis, but also for the treatment of influenza A and B, if started within 36 h after the onset of symptoms (163, 164).\n</p><p><b>SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n</b></p><p>The initial approach to managing patients with community-acquired pneumonia involves a determination of the presence of relevant factors that influence the likely etiologic pathogens. These factors include place of therapy (inpatient versus outpatient), the presence of cardiopulmonary disease, the presence of risk factors for drug-resistant pneumococci, the presence of risk factors for enteric gram-negative bacteria (including <i>P. aeruginosa</i>), and the severity of illness at presentation (mild, moderate, or severe). Once these assessments have been made, initial antimicrobial therapy can be selected according to the recommendations in Tables 2-5, and the choices will cover the most common pathogens likely for a given clinical setting. It is important to evaluate the response to initial therapy so that patients who are not adequately improving can be identified and properly evaluated.\n</p><p>The approach advocated in Tables 2-5 is different from several common clinical practices that have no firm basis in published studies. The practices include the use of sputum Gram's stain to define the likely etiologic pathogen and to guide initial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia; the use of extensive diagnostic testing in the initial evaluation of etiology; and the use of clinical syndromes to predict microbial etiology.\n</p><p>In several important areas of management, data are limited, and recommendations are not based on a firm scientific foundation. Future studies should focus on some of these pressing, but unanswered, questions: (<i>1</i>) How long should therapy be continued? (<i>2</i>) Should duration of therapy be related to severity of initial illness? (<i>3</i>) What role does antibiotic resistance play in the outcome of patients with CAP and how should initial therapy be modified to account for possible resistance? (<i>4</i>) Will newer diagnostic methods improve our ability to define the etiologic pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia, and will this information lead to improved outcomes? (<i>5</i>) What are the best criteria for defining the need for hospitalization? (<i>6</i>) How will antibiotic choices and guidelines for empiric therapy impact future patterns of antibiotic resistance? (<i>7</i>) Is atypical pathogen coinfection common and if so, is it prevalent all the time, or are there temporal and geographic variables to consider?\n</p><p>Often the distinction between pneumonia and bronchitis is uncertain, since even the chest radiograph may not be sensitive to early forms of pneumonia. This document is focused on the management of CAP, but the role of antibiotic therapy in patients with AECB needs further study, with a particular focus on whether specific types of antibiotic therapy should be targeted to specific patient populations. However, for CAP, the committee believes that guidelines can be useful for initial patient manage-\n</p><p>MICHAEL S. NIEDERMAN, M.D., <i>Co-chair\n</i>LIONEL A.

The statement includes a summary of the available literature, as well as evidence-based recommendations for patient management, developed by a multidisciplinary group composed of pulmonary, critical care, general internal medicine, and infectious disease specialists. The sections of this document are as follows: an overview of the purpose of our efforts and the methodology used to collect and grade the available data; a review of the likely etiologic pathogens causing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), including a discussion of drug-resistant\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\n\n(DRSP); a proposed approach to patient stratification for the purpose of predicting the likely etiologic pathogens of different patient populations with CAP; a summary of available and recommended diagnostic studies; suggestions on how to define the need for hospitalization and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for patients with CAP; guidelines for antibiotic therapy of CAP, including principles of therapy and specific recommendations for each patient category; an approach to the nonre-sponding patient, as well as a discussion of when to switch to oral therapy and when to discharge an admitted patient with CAP who is responding to initial therapy; and recommendations for the use of pneumococcal and influenza vaccines.\n\nLikely Pathogens and Patient Stratification\n\nAll CAP patients fall into one of four groups, each with a list of likely pathogens, and suggested empiric therapy follows from this list (\n\nsee\n\nFigure 1). Stratification is based on an assessment of place of therapy (outpatient, inpatient ward, or intensive care unit), the presence of cardiopulmonary disease, and the presence of \"modifying factors\" (\n\nsee\n\nTable 1), which include risk factors for DRSP, enteric gram-negatives, and\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa.\n\nNot every patient should be considered as being at risk for infection with DRSP, and clinical risk factors have been defined. The role of enteric gram-negatives in CAP is controversial, but these organisms do not need to be considered unless specific risk factors are present; however, one of these risk factors includes residence in a nursing home, a population that is not excluded from this statement.\n\nFor all patients with CAP, pneumococcus is the most common pathogen, and may even account for pneumonia in patients who have no pathogen identified by routine diagnostic testing. Although the incidence of DRSP is increasing, available data show that mortality in CAP is adversely affected by drug-resistant pneumococci only when minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values to penicillin are\n\n4 mg/L. The impact of organisms at lower levels of resistance remains uncertain. All patients with CAP could potentially be infected with\n\nChlamydia pneumoniae\n\n,\n\nMycoplasma pneumoniae\n\n, and\n\nLegionella\n\nspp. (the \"atypical\" pathogens), either alone or as part of a mixed infection, and thus all patients should receive therapy to account for this possibility. Although the term \"atypical pneumonia\" is not an accurate description of the clinical features of CAP, the use of the term \"atypical\" was retained in this statement to refer to the specific pathogens listed above. When patients with CAP are admitted to the ICU, the organisms responsible include pneumococcus, the \"atypical\" pathogens (especially\n\nLegionella\n\nin some series), and enteric gram-negatives.\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n\nhas been recovered from some patients with severe CAP, but this organism should be considered only when patients have well-identified risk factors present.\n\nDiagnostic Testing\n\nAll patients with CAP should have a chest radiograph to establish the diagnosis and the presence of complications (pleural effusion, multilobar disease), although in some outpatient settings, this may be impossible. All outpatients should have a careful assessment of disease severity, but sputum culture and Gram's stain are not required. All admitted patients with CAP should have an assessment of gas exchange (oximetry or arterial blood gas), routine blood chemistry and blood counts, and a collection of two sets of blood cultures. If a drug-resistant pathogen, or an organism not covered by usual empiric therapy, is suspected, sputum culture should be obtained, and Gram's stain should be used to guide interpretation of culture results. In general, sputum Gram's stain cannot be used to focus initial empiric antibiotic therapy, but could be used to broaden initial antibiotic therapy to include organisms found on the Gram's stain that are not covered by the usual initial empiric antibiotic therapy options. Routine serologic testing is not recommended for any population with CAP. For patients with severe CAP,\n\nLegionella\n\nurinary antigen should be measured, and aggressive efforts at establishing an etiologic diagnosis should be made, including the collection of bronchoscopic samples of lower respiratory secretions in selected patients, although the benefit of such efforts has not been proven.\n\nAdmission Decision and Need for ICU Care\n\nThe admission decision remains an \"art of medicine\" decision, and prognostic scoring rules (the Pneumonia Patient Out-\n\nThis statement was supported by an educational grant from Pfizer, Inc. Members of the ad hoc statement committee have disclosed any direct commercial associations (financial relationships or legal obligations) related to the preparation of this statement. This information is kept on file at the ATS headquarters.\n\ncomes Research Team [PORT] and British Thoracic Society rules), are adjunctive tools to support, but not replace, this process. In general, hospitalization is needed if patients have multiple risk factors for a complicated course, and these are summarized in this document. Patients may also need to be hospitalized for a variety of nonmedical reasons, and such social factors should also be incorporated into the admission decision process.\n\nAdmission to the ICU is needed for patients with severe CAP, defined as the presence of either one of two major criteria, or the presence of two of three minor criteria. The major criteria include need for mechanical ventilation and septic shock; the minor criteria include systolic blood pressure (BP)\n\n90 mm Hg, multilobar disease, and Pa\n\nO2\n\n/F\n\nIO2\n\nratio\n\n250. Patients who have two of four criteria from the British Thoracic Society rules also have more severe illness and should be considered for ICU admission. These criteria include respiratory rate\n\n30/min, diastolic blood pressure\n\n60 mm Hg, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)\n\n7.0 mM (\n\n19.1 mg/dl), and confusion.\n\nTherapy Principles and Recommendations\n\nPatients should initially be treated empirically, based on the likely pathogens for each of the four patient groups (\n\nsee\n\nTables 2-5), although when culture results become available, organism-specific therapy may be possible for some patients. All populations should be treated for the possibility of atypical pathogen infection, and this should be with a macrolide (or tetracycline) alone in outpatients, or an intravenous macrolide alone in inpatients who have no risk factors for DRSP, gram-negatives, or aspiration. For outpatients or non-ICU inpatients with risk factors for these other organisms, therapy should be with either a\n\n-lactam/macrolide combination or an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone alone. Although both regimens appear therapeutically equivalent, particularly among inpatients, in the outpatient treatment of the more complicated patient, an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone may be more convenient than a\n\n-lactam/macrolide combination. All admitted patients should receive their first dose of antibiotic therapy within 8 h of arrival to the hospital. In the ICU-admitted patient, current data do not support the use of an anti-pneumococcal fluoroquinolone alone, and therapy should be with a\n\n-lactam plus either a macrolide or quinolone, using a regimen with two antipseudomonal agents in appropriate, at-risk, patients.\n\nIf a\n\n-lactam/macrolide combination is used for a patient with risk factors for DRSP, only selected\n\n-lactams can be used, and these include oral therapy with cefpodoxime, amoxicillin/clavulanate, high-dose amoxicillin, or cefuroxime; or intravenous therapy with ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ampicillin/ sulbactam, or high-dose ampicillin. Ceftriaxone can also be given intramuscularly. There are several antibiotics, such as cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobac-tam that are generally clinically active against DRSP, but since these agents are also active against\n\nP. aeruginosa\n\n, they should be reserved for patients with risk factors for this organism.\n\nClinical Response, Switch to Oral Therapy, and Discharge\n\nMost patients with CAP will have an adequate clinical response within 3 d, and when the patient has met appropriate criteria, switch to oral therapy should be made. Criteria for switch include improvement in cough and dyspnea; afebrile (\n\n100\n\nF) on two occasions 8 h apart; white blood cell count decreasing; and functioning gastrointestinal tract with adequate oral intake. Even if the patient is febrile, switch therapy can occur, if other clinical features are favorable. If the patient\n\nhas met criteria for switch, oral therapy can be started and the patient discharged on the same day, if other medical and social factors permit.\n\nFor most patients, initial antibiotic therapy should not be changed in the first 72 h, unless there is a marked clinical deterioration. Up to 10% of all CAP patients will not respond to initial therapy, and a diagnostic evaluation is necessary to look for a drug-resistant or unusual (or unsuspected) pathogen, a nonpneumonia diagnosis (inflammatory disease or pulmonary embolus), or a pneumonia complication. This evaluation begins with a careful requestioning about epidemiologic factors that predispose to specific pathogens (\n\nsee\n\nTable 6).\n\nPrevention\n\nPneumonia can be prevented by the use of pneumococcal and influenza vaccines in appropriate at-risk populations. Smoking cessation should be promoted in all patients, and can also eliminate an important risk factor for CAP.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCommunity-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a common and serious illness, in spite of the availability of potent new antimicrobials and effective vaccines. In the United States, pneumonia is the sixth leading cause of death, and the number one cause of death from infectious diseases (1, 2). Because pneumonia is not a reportable illness, information about its incidence is based on crude estimates, but it appears that up to 5.6 million cases of community-acquired pneumonia occur annually, and as many as 1.1 million of these require hospitalization (1, 2). In the outpatient setting, the mortality rate of pneumonia remains low, in the range of\n\n1-5%, but among patients with community-acquired pneumonia who require hospitalization, the mortality rate averages 12% overall, but increases in specific populations, such as those with bacteremia, and those from nursing home settings, and approaches 40% in those who are most ill and who require admission to the intensive care unit (3-26).\n\nBoth the epidemiology and treatment of pneumonia have undergone changes. Pneumonia is increasingly being recognized among older patients and those with comorbidity (coexisting illness) (2, 15, 18, 19, 21). Such illnesses include chronic obstructive lung disease, diabetes mellitus, renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, malignancy, chronic neurologic disease, and chronic liver disease (15). These individuals may become infected with a variety of newly identified, or previously unrecognized, pathogens (5, 14, 17, 27-32). At the same time, a number of new antimicrobial agents have become available, some with utility for community-acquired pneumonia. Paralleling the improvement in our antibiotic armamentarium has been the evolution of bacterial resistance mechanisms. In the 1990s, many of the common respiratory pathogens have become resistant,\n\nin vitro\n\n, to widely used antimicrobials. Resistance, by a variety of mechanisms, is being identified with increasing frequency among\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\n\n,\n\nHemophilus influenzae\n\n,\n\nMoraxella catarrha-lis\n\n, and a number of enteric gram-negative bacteria (33-39). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common illness, affecting up to 15 million persons in the United States, with more than 12 million having a component of illness characterized as chronic bronchitis, and these patients commonly develop community-acquired respiratory infections, including pneumonia (40). COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States, and age-adjusted death rates in this illness have risen, whereas other common causes of death such as heart disease and cerebral vascular disease have fallen (40-\n\n42). This population is prone to frequent acute bronchitic exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (AECB), and bacterial infection is believed to play a role in at least half of these episodes (43). Although most experts agree that antibiotics should not be used in patients with acute bronchitis in the absence of chronic lung disease, the role of antibiotic therapy in AECB is controversial, with some patients receiving such therapy and others not. At the current time, the role of antibiotic therapy in this illness is uncertain, and it remains unclear whether specific subpopulations of patients with AECB can be defined for the purpose of prescribing different therapy to different patients. In 1993, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) published guidelines for the initial management of community-acquired pneumonia, based on available knowledge and a consensus of experts (44). Since that time, new information has become available in many areas related to this illness, including prognostic scoring to predict mortality, new knowledge of the bacteriology of this illness, and new approaches to providing care in a cost-effective and efficient manner. Since 1993, a number of new antibiotics have been approved for the therapy of CAP, in at least four different drug classes. At the same time,\n\nin vitro\n\nantibiotic resistance among the organisms causing CAP has become increasingly prevalent, and the clinical relevance of resistance is beginning to be understood.\n\nGoals of This Document\n\nThis document is a revision of the initial CAP guidelines, intended to update and expand on the original statement, by including more recent information as well as by covering new areas such as pneumonia prevention and the importance of drug-resistant organisms. It includes not only elements from the original ATS CAP guidelines, but also takes into account the recommendations from the more recently published guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA, Alexandria, VA) and the newly published Canadian CAP document (45, 46). The discussion is limited to the apparently immunocompetent patient with community-acquired pneumonia, because this represents the population most commonly encountered. However, patients with immune suppression due to chronic corticosteroid therapy and due to nonhe-matologic malignancy (without neutropenia) are commonly treated by many types of physicians, and the approach to these patients is included in this document. The approach to other immunocompromised patients is different, because of the large number of potential etiologic agents for pneumonia in these individuals. Thus the discussion does not deal with the problems of pneumonia in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patient, or in those immunocompromised as a result of myelosuppressive chemotherapy, organ transplantation, or \"traditional\" immunosuppressive illnesses, such as Hodgkin's disease.\n\nThe goal of this statement is to provide a framework for the\n\nevaluation and therapy\n\nof the patient with community-acquired pneumonia. The most common pathogens have been defined from published studies, and the determination of which diagnostic tests should be obtained routinely has been made on the basis of published data. While organism-directed antimicrobial therapy would be ideal because of reduced costs, reduction in adverse drug reactions, and antibiotic selection pressure, the limitations of our current diagnostic methods force us to rely on empiric antibiotic therapy in most patients with CAP. The approach to such therapy must be based on an assessment of the likelihood that a given pathogen is causing disease in a given patient, a determination guided by information from the literature. The major variables that influence the spectrum of etiologic agents and the initial approach to therapy are the severity of illness at initial presentation, the presence of coexisting illness, and the presence of identified clinical risk factors for drug-resistant and unusual pathogens (Table 1). Patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia have a distinct epidemiology and a somewhat different distribution of etiologic pathogens than do patients with other forms of pneumonia (8, 9, 16, 19, 20, 23, 24, 47, 48). Once empiric therapy has been initiated, other decisions, such as the duration of therapy and the change from parenteral to oral therapy, become relevant. Finally, it is inevitable that empiric therapy will not be successful for all patients, and thus an approach is provided for use if the patient is not responding to the selected regimen.\n\nMethodology Used to Prepare This Document\n\nThe development of these guidelines was by a committee composed of pulmonary, critical care, infectious disease, and general internal medicine specialists, in an effort to incorporate a variety of perspectives and to create a statement that was acceptable to a wide range of physicians. The committee originally met as a group, with each individual being assigned a topic for review and presentation to the entire group, during a two-day meeting. Each topic in the guideline was reviewed by more than one committee member, and following presentation of information, the committee discussed the data and formulated its recommendations. Each section of the statement was then prepared by committee members, and a draft document incorporating all sections was written. This document was circulated to the committee for review and modification and then the committee met again in May of 2000 to deliberate on suggested changes. The manuscript was then revised and circulated to the committee for final comment. This final statement represents the results of this process and the opinions of the majority of the committee. For any topic in which there was disagreement, the majority position was adopted. We used an evidence-based approach for making final recommendations, after review of all available and relevant peer-reviewed studies (collected by literature search and selected by the experts reviewing each topic), published until Decem-ber 2000. Much of the literature on the etiology, epidemiology, and diagnostic approach to respiratory infections is observational, and only a few therapy trials have been conducted in a prospective randomized fashion. Therefore, in grading the evidence supporting our recommendations, we used the following scale, similar to the approach used in the recently updated Canadian CAP statement (46): Level I evidence comes from well-conducted randomized controlled trials; Level II evidence comes from well-designed, controlled trials without\n\nTABLE 1. MODIFYING FACTORS THAT INCREASE THE RISK OF INFECTION WITH SPECIFIC PATHOGENS\n\nPenicillin-resistant and drug-resistant pneumococci Age\n\n65 yr\n\n-Lactam therapy within the past 3 mo Alcoholism\n\nImmune-suppressive illness (including therapy with corticosteroids) Multiple medical comorbidities\n\nExposure to a child in a day care center Enteric gram-negatives\n\nResidence in a nursing home Underlying cardiopulmonary disease Multiple medical comorbidities\n\nRecent antibiotic therapy\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n\nStructural lung disease (bronchiectasis) Corticosteroid therapy (\n\n10 mg of prednisone per day) Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy for\n\n7 d in the past month Malnutrition randomization (including cohort, patient series, and case control studies); Level III evidence comes from case studies and expert opinion. Level II studies included any large case series in which systematic analysis of disease patterns and/or microbial etiology was conducted, as well as reports of new therapies that were not collected in a randomized fashion. In some instances therapy recommendations come from antibiotic susceptibility data, without clinical observations, and these constitute Level III recommendations.\n\nWhile numerous studies detailing the incidence and etiology of pneumonia have been published, all have limitations. The approach used in this statement is based on an evaluation of studies that were long enough to avoid seasonal bias and recent enough to include newly recognized pathogens. Therefore, we reviewed the available literature, emphasizing data from prospective studies of one or more years' duration, reported in the past 15 years, involving adults in North America and elsewhere (3-32, 37, 38, 47). We focused on studies that included an extensive diagnostic approach to define the etiologic pathogen, and which did not rely on sputum Gram's stain and culture alone for this determination. Most involved hospitalized patients, but a wide spectrum of patients was included, ranging from outpatients to those admitted to an intensive care unit. In some of the studies, patients were receiving antimicrobials at the time of initial diagnostic evaluation, and the committee considered information from such studies of uncertain reliability.\n\nETIOLOGY OF COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA\n\nTypes of Data Reviewed\n\nWhile a rapid diagnosis is optimal in the management of community-acquired pneumonia, the responsible pathogen is not defined in as many as 50% of patients, even when extensive diagnostic testing is performed (3-5, 13-15). No single test is presently available that can identify all potential pathogens, and each diagnostic test has limitations. For example, sputum Gram's stain and culture may be discordant for the presence of\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\n\n, and these tests are also not able to detect frequently encountered pathogens such as\n\nMycoplasma pneumoniae\n\n,\n\nChlamydia pneumoniae\n\n,\n\nLegionella\n\nspp., and respiratory viruses (49, 50). In addition, several studies have reported that some patients with CAP can have mixed infection involving both bacterial and \"atypical\" pathogens. This type of mixed infection may require therapy of all the identified pathogens, but cannot be diagnosed initially with readily available clinical specimens (13, 15, 17). In addition, mixed infection can involve more than one bacterial species, or can involve both a bacterial pathogen and a viral organism (13, 17, 28).\n\nThe role of \"atypical\" pathogens is controversial because the frequency of these organisms is largely dependent on the diagnostic tests and criteria used, and it is uncertain whether these organisms infect along with a bacterial pathogen, or if they cause an initial infection that then predisposes to secondary bacterial infection (13, 17, 28). The very term \"atypical\" pathogen is potentially misleading since the clinical syndrome caused by these organisms is not distinctive (\n\nsee below\n\n), but in this statement the term \"atypical\" is used to refer to a group of organisms (\n\nMycoplasma pneumoniae\n\n,\n\nChlamydia pneumoniae\n\n,\n\nLegionella\n\nspp.), rather than to a clinical picture. The data supporting the presence of atypical pathogen coinfection (which has varied in frequency from as low as 3% to as high as 40%) have generally been derived by serologic testing, documenting fourfold rises in titers to\n\nM. pneumoniae\n\n,\n\nC. pneumoniae\n\n, or Legionella spp., and some of these diagnoses have even been made with single high acute titers (14, 17). Since many of these diagnoses have not\n\ninvolved testing for the surface antigens of these pathogens, or cultures of respiratory secretions, the clinical significance of the serologic data remains uncertain.\n\nIn defining the bacteriology of CAP, we examined the likely etiologic pathogens for each patient category, adding new information about the emerging resistance of common CAP pathogens such as pneumococcus,\n\nH. influenzae\n\n, and\n\nM. catarrhalis\n\n(33-39). In addition, there is now an increased awareness of the importance of newly recognized pathogens (such as hantavirus) and of \"atypical\" pathogens. In most studies, a large number of patients have no defined etiology. This is likely a reflection of a number of factors, including prior treatment with antibiotics, the presence of unusual pathogens that go unrecognized (fungi,\n\nCoxiella burnetii\n\n), the presence of viral infection, the presence of a noninfectious mimic of CAP, and the presence of pathogens that are currently not identified or recognized.\n\nOrganisms Causing CAP in Outpatients\n\nRelatively few studies have been conducted in ambulatory patients with CAP and in this group an unknown diagnosis is present in 40-50% of all patients (11, 12, 30, 31, 51). When a pathogen has been identified, the nature of the organisms has reflected the population studied and the types of diagnostic tests performed. With use of sputum culture, pneumococcus is the most commonly identified pathogen (9-20% of all episodes), while\n\nM. pneumoniae\n\nis the most common organism (accounting for 13-37% of all episodes) identified when serologic testing is performed (11, 12, 51).\n\nChlamydia pneumoniae\n\nhas been reported in up to 17% of outpatients with CAP (51). In the outpatient setting,\n\nLegionella\n\nspp. have also been seen, with rates varying from 0.7 to 13% of all patients (30). The incidence of viral infection is variable, but in one series was identified in 36% of patients (30). The incidence of gram-negative infection in ambulatory patients is difficult to define from currently available studies, but the complexity of the population that is currently treated out of the hospital is increasing, and many of these patients have well-identified risk factors for colonization of the respiratory tract by gram-negative bacilli, a common predisposing factor to pneumonia with these pathogens (52).\n\nOrganisms Causing CAP in Non-ICU-Hospitalized Patients\n\nOn the basis of a review of 15 published studies from North America, over 3 decades in primarily hospitalized patients, Bartlett and Mundy (22) concluded that\n\nS. pneumoniae\n\nwas the most commonly identified pathogen (20-60% of all episodes), followed by\n\nH. influenzae\n\n(3-10% of all episodes), and then by\n\nStaphylococcus aureus\n\n, enteric gram-negatives,\n\nLe-gionella\n\n,\n\nM. pneumoniae\n\n,\n\nC. pneumoniae\n\n, and viruses (up to 10% of episodes for each of these latter agents). In addition, some patients (3-6%) have pneumonia due to aspiration. In all studies, an etiologic agent was not found in 20-70% of patients (4, 5, 8, 13, 14, 18, 21). For many years, patients with an unknown diagnosis were assumed to have the same distribution of pathogens as those with an established diagnosis, since the outcomes in both groups were similar, but one study of hospitalized patients suggested that many patients without a known diagnosis actually have pneumococcal infection (53). In several studies of hospitalized patients with CAP, there has been a high incidence of atypical pathogen infection, primarily\n\nM. pneumoniae\n\nand\n\nC. pneumoniae\n\namong those outside the ICU, while the incidence of\n\nLegionella\n\ninfection has been low in patients who are not admitted to the ICU (8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17). The incidence of infection with these \"atypical\" organisms has been as high as 40-60% of all admitted patients, often as part of a mixed infection, but the findings have not been corroborated by all investigators (13, 17, 54). This high incidence was identified primarily by serologic testing that included single high acute titers as well as a 4-fold rise between acute and convalescent titers, but the serologic criteria and diagnostic tests used for these organisms are not standardized, and include the use of IgG and IgM titers. When atypical pathogens have been identified, they have not been confined to the population of young and healthy patients, but rather have been found in patients of all age groups (14). Even in series that do not identify a high incidence of atypical pathogens, they are often part of a mixed infection when they are identified (13, 54). The importance of mixed infection is also uncertain, with some investigators reporting that coinfection with bacterial and atypical pathogens leads to a more complicated course than monomicrobial infection, while others report no impact on the clinical course (28, 54). On the basis of these data, it is difficult to define the importance of these organisms and the need for specific therapy. However, several outcome studies show that both inpatients and outpatients have a less complicated clinical course if a macrolide is used as part of the therapy regimen, or if a quinolone is used alone (55-58). Enteric gram-negative bacteria are not common in CAP, but may be present in up to 10% of non-ICU-hospitalized patients. They have been found most commonly in those who have underlying comorbid illness (particularly COPD) on previous oral antibiotic therapy, in those coming from nursing homes, and those with hematologic malignancy or immune suppression (the latter not being covered in this statement) (8, 15, 16, 18, 19). In one study, enteric gram-negatives were identified in 9% of patients, and in 11% of all pathogens, and the presence of any of the following comorbidities was associated with an increased risk of infection (odds ratio 4.4) with these organisms: cardiac illness, chronic lung disease, renal insufficiency, toxic liver disease, chronic neurologic illness, diabetes, and malignancy active within the last year (15). Although the incidence of\n\nP. aeruginosa\n\ninfection is not high in most patients with CAP, this organism was found in 4% of all CAP patients with an established etiologic diagnosis (14, 15). There is still controversy about the true incidence of gram-negative infection in patients with CAP, since diagnostic testing that involves sputum culture cannot always distinguish between colonization by these organisms and true infection. The incidence of gram-negative infection is not as high in all admitted patients with CAP, but rises among those admitted to the ICU, as discussed below (8, 16, 20, 47).\n\nOrganisms Causing CAP in Hospitalized Patients Requiring ICU Admission\n\nWhile gram-negative aerobic organisms have been identified with an increased frequency in patients with CAP requiring intensive care, the most common organisms in patients falling into this category are pneumococcus,\n\nLegionella\n\n, and\n\nH. influ-enzae\n\n, with some series reporting\n\nS. aureus\n\nas a common pathogen (8, 9, 16, 23). In addition, atypical pathogens such as\n\nC. pneumoniae\n\nand\n\nM. pneumoniae\n\ncan lead to severe illness, and in at least one study, these organisms were more common than\n\nLegionella\n\nin causing severe CAP (16). Overall, up to 10% of admitted patients with CAP are brought to the ICU, and pneumococcus is present in up to one-third of all patients (8, 9, 16, 20). Among patients admitted to the ICU, organisms such as\n\nP. aeruginosa\n\nhave been identified, particularly in individuals with underlying bronchiectasis (8, 16, 20, 47). In this population, the Enterobacteriaceae have been found in up to 22% of patients, and up to an additional 10-15% of ICU patients in some series have infection with\n\nP. aeruginosa\n\n(20, 23, 47). In all of these series, 50-60% of patients with severe CAP have an unknown etiology, and the failure to define a pathogen in these patients has not been associated with a different outcome than if a pathogen is identified (20, 24).\n\nDrug-resistant Pneumococcus in CAP\n\nThe emergence of DRSP is an increasingly common problem in the United States and elsewhere, with more than 40% of all pneumococci falling into this category by current\n\nin vitro\n\ndefinitions of resistance (35, 59-60a). Controversy continues, however, about the clinical relevance of\n\nin vitro\n\nresistance in the absence of meningitis, and whether the problem, as currently defined, requires new therapeutic approaches or whether the presence of resistance influences the outcome of CAP (33, 34, 37, 38, 59, 60). The current definitions of resistance include \"intermediate-level\" resistance with penicillin MIC values of 0.12-1.0\n\ng/ml, while \"high-level\" resistance is defined as MIC values of\n\n2.0\n\ng/ml (60). When resistance to penicillin is present, there is often\n\nin vitro\n\nresistance to other agents, including cephalosporins, macrolides, doxycycline, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxizole (35, 60a). In one survey, with isolates collected as recently as 1998, when high-level penicillin resistance was present,\n\nin vitro\n\nresistance to cefotaxime was 42%, to meropenem 52%, to erythromycin 61%, and to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxizole 92% (60a). The newer antipneumo-coccal fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, trovafloxacin, and sparfloxacin), the ketolides, and vancomycin are active agents for DRSP, and linezolid, a newly available oxazolidinone, is also active against DRSP. Although quinolone resistant pneumococci have been uncommon, one recent report found that 2.9% of pneumococcal isolates from adults were ciprofloxacin resistant and that 4.1% of isolates with high level penicillin resistance were also quinolone (ciprofloxa-cin) resistant (61). When ciprofloxacin resistance was present,\n\nin vitro\n\nresistance to the newer quinolones was also present.\n\nThe clinical relevance of DRSP has been debated, but in the absence of meningitis, clinical failure with high-dose\n\n-lactam therapy is currently unlikely (60). Using currently defined levels of resistance, most investigators have found no difference in mortality for patients infected with resistant or sensitive organisms, after controlling for comorbid illness, although patients with resistant organisms may have a more prolonged hospital stay (33, 34). One study has shown that suppurative complications (such as empyema) are more common in patients with penicillin-nonsusceptible organisms than in patients with susceptible organisms, even though the majority of patients received apparently adequate therapy (62). In Spain, where the incidence of high-level DRSP is higher than in the United States, the presence of resistance has been reported to cause a rise in mortality, which was not statistically significant (38). In another study of a population with a high incidence of HIV infection, the presence of high-level penicillin resistance (as defined above) was associated with increased mortality, in spite of most patients receiving therapy that appeared to be appropriate (63). A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, Atlanta, GA) study has shown that the breakpoint for clinically relevant resistance to penicillin is an MIC value of\n\n4.0\n\ng/ml (37). At these levels, resistance was associated with increased mortality in patients with invasive disease (primarily bacteremia), provided that patients dying in the first 4 d of therapy were excluded from the analysis (37). When these levels of resistance are suspected (or documented), alternative agents to penicillin should be used, and these are discussed below, although routine therapy with vancomycin is rarely needed (60).\n\nNot all patients in areas with high geographic rates of DRSP are likely to be infected with these organisms, and even in areas with high rates of resistance, organisms isolated from sputum and blood cultures are less commonly resistant than or- ganisms isolated from the upper respiratory tract (64). Identified risk factors for DRSP include age\n\n65 years (odds ratio [OR], 3.8), alcoholism (OR, 5.2), noninvasive disease (suggesting possibly reduced virulence of resistant organisms) (OR, 4.5),\n\n-lactam therapy within 3 mo (OR, 2.8), multiple medical comorbidities, exposure to children in a day care center, and immunosuppressive illness (38, 59, 65, 66). In one study, the effect of age was less clear, with individuals\n\nage 65 yr having an odds ratio of 1.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0-1.5) corresponding to an incidence of DRSP of 24%, compared with an incidence of 19% in those aged 18-64 yr (60a).\n\nPATIENT STRATIFICATION\n\nFeatures Used to Define Patient Subsets\n\nWe divided patients into four groups on the basis of place of therapy (outpatient, hospital ward, or intensive care unit); the presence of coexisting cardiopulmonary disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure); and the presence of \"modifying factors,\" which included the presence of risk factors for drug-resistant pneumococcus, the presence of risk factors for gram-negative infection (including nursing home residence), and the presence of risk factors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (specifically in patients requiring ICU admission) (Table 1) (15, 19, 27). The history of cigarette smoking was not used to classify patients, since all of the recommended therapy regimens account for H. influenzae, the organism that is more likely to occur in smokers than in nonsmokers. In this approach to stratification, the place of therapy is a reflection of severity of illness, with the need for hospitalization and the need for ICU admission being defined by the criteria described in subsequent sections of this statement.\n\nIn the previous version of the ATS CAP guidelines, age was used as a major discriminating factor among patients to define bacterial etiology. This concept has not been corroborated by studies that have shown that age alone, in the absence of comorbid illness, has little impact on the bacterial etiology of CAP (18, 19, 67). As discussed above, the elderly patient can have infection by \"atypical\" pathogens, and enteric gram-negatives are common primarily in those with comorbid illness (particularly underlying COPD), recent antibiotic therapy, and in patients residing in nursing homes (8, 15). One pathogen whose presence may be impacted by age alone is drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP), with several studies showing that age 65 is, by itself, a specific epidemiologic risk for CAP due to this organism, but is not an independent risk factor for other organisms (38, 59).\n\nRisk factors for penicillin and drug-resistant pneumococcus were defined from the literature, and are summarized in Table 1. Risk factors for enteric gram-negatives include residence in a nursing home, underlying cardiopulmonary disease, multiple medical comorbidities, and recent antibiotic therapy (15, 18, 19, 52). The risk factors for P. aeruginosa include the presence of any of the following: structural lung disease such as bronchiectasis, corticosteroid therapy ( 10 mg of prednisone per day), broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy for 7 d in the past month, malnutrition, and leukopenic immune suppression (the latter is not included in this statement) (8, 15, 16, 68).\n\nPatient Subsets\n\nUsing these factors, the four patient groups were defined (Tables 2-5 and Figure 1) as the following:\n\nI. Outpatients with no history of cardiopulmonary disease, and no modifying factors (Table 2)\n\nII. Outpatients with cardiopulmonary disease (congestive heart failure or COPD) and/or other modifying factors (risk factors for DRSP or gram-negative bacteria) (Table 3)\n\nIII. Inpatients, not admitted to the ICU, who have the following (Table 4):\n\na. Cardiopulmonary disease, and/or other modifying factors (including being from a nursing home) b. No cardiopulmonary disease, and no other modifying factors\n\nIV. ICU-admitted patients who have the following (Table 5): a. No risks for Pseudomonas aeruginosa b. Risks for Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n\nFor each group, results from available studies were combined to identify the most common pathogens associated with pneumonia and an attempt was made to rank the incidence of pathogens broadly, but a precise numeric incidence or percentage was not included. Patients with nursing home-acquired pneumonias were included, with the realization that this population is unique, and that a knowledge of local (institution-specific) epidemics and antibiotic susceptibility patterns is necessary to choose optimal empiric therapy. However, the following pathogens are recognized more frequently in nursing home patients than in patients with the same coexisting illnesses who are residing in the community: methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), enteric gram-negative bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and certain viral agents (i.e., adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], and influenza) (18, 69-71). A miscellaneous group is included in each of Tables 2- 5 and represents organisms that were present in about 1% of patients in these studies, or pathogens that have been otherwise reported to occur in this setting.\n\nSpecific Pathogens for Each Patient Subset\n\nThe most common pathogens in Group I, that is, outpatients with no cardiopulmonary disease and no risks for DRSP or gram-negatives, include S. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, and respiratory viruses (Level II evidence). Miscellaneous pathogens include Legionella sp. (usually a more severe illness), M. tuberculosis, and endemic fungi. Although H. influenzae can be seen in this group of patients, it is a particular concern if the patient has a history of cigarette smoking. This population has a mortality rate of 1-5% (10,72). For patients in Group II, the presence of cardiopulmonary disease (congestive heart failure or COPD), or the presence of\n\nTABLE 2.

Although pneumococcus remains the most likely pathogen, resistance to penicillin and other agents (mac-rolides, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxizole) is more likely, and this should be considered in antibiotic selection (below). In addition, if the patient is from a nursing home, then aerobic gram-negative infection is possible and can include the Enter-obacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli, or Klebsiella spp., and even P. aeruginosa (if bronchiectasis is present) (Level II evidence). Also, in this population, aspiration with anaerobes should be considered in the presence of poor dentition and if the patient has a history of neurologic illness, impaired consciousness, or a swallowing disorder. Less common pathogens include Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella sp., Mycobacterium sp., and endemic fungi. Mortality in this setting is also 5%, but as many as 20% of patients initially treated as outpatients may require hospitalization (72).\n\nWhen the patient is hospitalized, there are usually risks for DRSP and enteric gram-negatives, or underlying cardiopulmonary disease, and these factors influence the likely pathogens (Group IIIa). These patients are at risk for infection with pneumococcus, H. influenzae, atypical pathogens (alone or as a mixed infection), as well as enteric gram-negatives such as the Enterobacteriaceae, and also a polymicrobial bacterial flora including anaerobes associated with aspiration (if risk factors are present). All admitted patients are also at risk for M. tuberculosis and endemic fungi, but these are less commonly identified than the other organisms listed above. Tuberculosis is a particular concern in patients who have been born in foreign countries with high rates of endemic illness, in the alcoholic, and in the elderly who reside in nursing homes. Mortality rates reported for these patients ranged from 5 to 25%, and most of the deaths occurred within the first 7 d (3, 10). If, however, the admitted patient has no cardiopulmonary disease, and no risks for DRSP or gram-negatives (Group IIIb), then the most likely pathogens are S. pneumoniae, H. influen-\n\nzae, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, viruses, and possibly Le-gionella sp. (Level II evidence).\n\nIn some studies of admitted patients with CAP, the etiology may be polymicrobial. The incidence of \"mixed\" infection, usually a bacterial pathogen and an \"atypical\" pathogen, varies from 10% to up to 40% (10, 12, 13, 17, 28). Atypical pathogens have been frequently identified in admitted patients of all age groups. The difference in relative incidence of \"mixed\" infections may relate to how aggressively investigators collected both acute and convalescent titers, and to the type of criteria used to define the presence of these pathogens (single-titer versus 4-fold rise in titers) (13, 17).\n\nSevere community-acquired pneumonia (defined below) has been separated from cases of less severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization, because of the high mortality rate (up to 50%) and the need for immediate recognition of patients with this severity of illness (8-10, 16, 10, 24, 47, 48). Although severe pneumonia was defined differently by the various investigators, a practical approach defines all patients admitted to the ICU because of respiratory infection as having severe illness (see below) (48). The pathogens most frequently identified among patients with severe pneumonia (Group IVa) include S. pneumoniae, Legionella sp., H. influenzae, enteric gram-negative bacilli, S. aureus, M. pneumoniae, respiratory tract viruses, and a group of miscellaneous pathogens (C. pneumo-niae, M. tuberculosis, and endemic fungi) (8, 9, 16, 19, 20, 23, 47). In one study, the incidence of Legionella sp. in patients with severe CAP decreased over time, in one hospital, but was replaced by other atypical pathogens, such as C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae (16). There has been some debate about whether P. aeruginosa can lead to severe CAP, and although this organism has been reported in some studies (in 1.5-5% of such patients), the committee felt that this pathogen should be considered only when specific risk factors are present (Group IVb) (8, 16, 20, 47) (Level III evidence). These risks include chronic or prolonged ( 7 d within the past month) broad-\n\nTABLE 3.

Undiagnosed HIV infection has been identified as a risk factor for CAP due to P. aeruginosa (73). The frequency of S. aureus as a severe CAP pathogen is also variable, being present in anywhere from 1 to 22% of all patients. Risks for infection with this organism include recent influenza infection, diabetes, and renal failure (74).\n\nDIAGNOSTIC STUDIES OF PATIENTS WITH COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA\n\nThe diagnosis of pneumonia should be considered in any patient who has newly acquired respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum production, and/or dyspnea), especially if accompanied by fever and auscultatory findings of abnormal breath sounds and crackles. In a patient with advanced age or an inadequate immune response, pneumonia may present with nonrespira-tory symptoms such as confusion, failure to thrive, worsening of an underlying chronic illness, or falling down (21, 71). In these patients, fever may be absent, but tachypnea is usually present, along with an abnormal physical examination of the chest (75). In the initial evaluation of the patient with CAP, the history may on occasion help to identify patients at risk for infection with specific organisms, as outlined in Table 6. Standard posteroanterior (PA) and lateral chest radiographs are valuable in patients whose symptoms and physical examination suggest the possibility of pneumonia, and every effort should be made to obtain this information. The radiograph can be useful in differentiating pneumonia from other conditions that may mimic it. In addition, the radiographic findings may suggest specific etiologies or conditions which as lung abscess, or tuberculosis. The radiograph can also identify coexisting conditions such as bronchial obstruction or pleural effusion. In some patients, the history and physical examination suggest the presence of pneumonia, but the radiograph is negative. One study has shown that some of these radiographically negative patients do have lung infiltrates if a high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest is done (76). However, the clinical relevance of these findings is uncertain, since most studies of CAP have required the presence of a lung infiltrate on a routine chest radiograph to define the presence of pneumonia. Radiography is also useful for evaluating severity of illness by identifying multilobar involvement (below). However, in certain outpatient settings, depending on the time of day and the availability of a radiology facility, it may be difficult to obtain a chest radiograph.\n\nOnce the diagnosis of CAP is established, an effort should be made to identify a specific etiologic diagnosis in a timely manner, with focused and appropriate diagnostic testing. However, even with extensive diagnostic testing, most investigators cannot identify a specific etiology for community-acquired pneumonia in up to half, or more, of all patients. If an exact etiology is identified, then therapy can be focused and cost-effective, but this goal needs to be tempered by two findings. First, if diagnostic testing leads to delays in the initiation of appropriate therapy, it may have an adverse outcome. One large Medicare study showed that 30-d CAP mortality was increased when administration of the first dose of antibiotic\n\nFigure 1.\n\nTABLE 5.

Second, since the possibility of coinfection is a consideration, with a bacteria and an atypical pathogen (which may take days or weeks to identify), the value of focused therapy, directed at a rapidly identified bacterial etiology, is uncertain. In fact, in large population studies, treatment that accounted for atypical pathogen coinfection led to a better outcome than treatment that did not account for this possibility (55-57) (Level II evidence).\n\nOne of the most controversial recommendations in the 1993 ATS guidelines for CAP was that a sputum Gram's stain and culture not be performed routinely in all admitted patients (44). Although its value is debated, some experts, including the IDSA consensus group, believe that a properly collected and examined Gram's stain of expectorated sputum is helpful for focusing initial empiric therapy in CAP (45). A lower respiratory tract sample that is not heavily contaminated by oral secretions will typically have fewer than 10 squamous epithelial cells, and 25 neutrophils per low-power field (45). Studies of the sputum Gram's stain have shown limitations, which include the following: not all patients can provide an adequate sample (either because of an inability to produce a sample, or because the sample is of poor quality), interpretation is observer dependent, atypical pathogens (which are common either singly or as coinfecting agents, as discussed above) cannot be seen, the definition of \"positive\" varies from study to study, and a positive result for pneumococcus is poorly predictive of the ability to recover that organism from a sputum or blood culture (49, 50). In addition, there are no studies correlating data from Gram's stain of expectorated sputum with cultures of alveolar material in large numbers of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. However, direct staining of sputum (non-Gram stain methods) may be diagnostic for some pulmonary infections including those due to Mycobacterium sp., endemic fungi, Legionella sp. (direct fluorescent antibody staining is required), and Pneu-mocytis carinii.\n\nIf a sputum Gram's stain is used to determine initial therapy, the clinician must decide whether liberal criteria are being used to increase the sensitivity of the test (with a corresponding drop in specificity), or whether more stringent criteria are being used to increase the specificity of the test (with a corresponding drop in sensitivity) (49). The debate about the value of Gram's stain may be less relevant with the advent of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act, which has limited the use of this test to laboratory personnel who often interpret the results without knowledge of the clinical scenario and suspected pathogens.\n\nRoutine bacterial cultures of sputum often demonstrate pathogenic organisms, but sensitivity and specificity are poor, and findings should be correlated with the predominant organism identified on Gram's stain (50). However, recovery from cultures of organisms that are not usually part of the normal respiratory flora may be meaningful. Specialized cultures for Mycobacterium sp., Legionella sp., and endemic fungi may be valuable in the appropriate clinical circumstance. When drug-resistant pneumococci, other resistant pathogens, or organisms not covered by the usual empiric therapy options (such as S. aureus) are anticipated (particularly if the patient has risk factors, or is receiving antibiotics at the time of admission) sputum culture and sensitivity results may be useful. Viral cultures are not useful in the initial evaluation of patients with community-acquired pneumonia and should not be routinely performed (3). However, in the appropriate season, testing of respiratory secretions for influenza antigens, using rapid detection methods, may be helpful in guiding decisions about the use of new antiviral agents.\n\nRecommended Testing\n\nFor the patient with CAP initially managed out of the hospital, diagnostic testing should include a chest radiograph and may include a sputum Gram's stain and culture, if drug-resistant bacteria, or an organism not covered by the usual empiric therapy options, are suspected (Level II evidence). In addition, it is necessary to assess severity of illness, relying on radiographic findings (multilobar pneumonia, pleural effusion), and physical findings (respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, signs of dehydration, and mental status) (78-80). If the patient has underlying chronic heart or lung disease, then assessment of oxygenation by pulse oximetry may help define the need for hospitalization and supplemental oxygen. Routine laboratory tests (complete blood counts, serum electrolytes, hepatic enzymes, and tests of renal function) are of little value in determining the etiology of pneumonia, but may have prognostic significance and influence the decision to hospitalize. They should be considered in patients who may need hospitalization, and in patients age 65 yr or with coexisting illness (Level II evidence).\n\nFor the patient who is admitted, diagnostic testing should be performed rapidly, avoiding delays in the administration of initial empiric therapy, for the reasons stated above. In addition to a chest radiograph, an admitted patient should have a complete blood count and differential, and routine blood chemistry testing (including glucose, serum sodium, liver and renal function tests, and electrolytes) (Level III evidence). All admitted patients should have oxygen saturation assessed by oximetry. Arterial blood gas should be obtained in any patient with severe illness, or in any patient with chronic lung disease, to assess both the level oxygenation and the degree of carbon dioxide retention. Sputum cultures are recommended if a drug-resistant pathogen, or an organism not covered by usual em-\n\nTABLE 6.

If a sputum culture is obtained, efforts should be made to collect it prior to antibiotic administration. Any culture result should be correlated with the predominant organism identified on Gram's stain of an appropriate specimen, which should be performed in conjuction with a sputum culture (Level III evidence). Otherwise, in the absence of a culture, a sputum Gram's stain is optional. However, it is the consensus of the majority of the CAP statement committee that if a sputum Gram's stain is used to guide initial therapy, it should be with highly sensitive criteria (any gram-positive diplococci, rather than a predominance of such organisms), with the primary purpose being to visualize a bacterial morphology of an organism that was not anticipated, so that appropriate drugs can be added to the initial antibiotic regimen (e.g., S. aureus, or enteric gram-negatives) (Level III evidence). This conclusion differs from that of the IDSA consensus group, which recommended using Gram's stain to narrow initial empiric therapy in patients with certain organism-specific findings (45). Two sets of blood cultures should be drawn before initiation of antibiotic therapy, and may help to identify the presence of bacteremia and of a resistant pathogen, with the overall yield being approximately 11%, and with S. pneumoniae being the most common pathogen identified by this method (46). Any significant pleural effusion ( 10-mm thickness on lateral decubitus film) or any loculated pleural effusion should be sampled, preferably prior to the initiation of antibiotic therapy, to rule out the possibility of empyema or complicated parapneumonic effusion; however, there are no data showing an outcomes benefit to delaying antibiotic therapy for the purpose of performing a thoracentesis. Pleural fluid examination should include white blood cell count and differential; measurement of protein, glucose, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and pH; Gram's stain and acid-fast stain; as well as culture for bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria. Serologic testing and cold agglutinin measurements are not useful in the initial evaluation of patients with community-acquired pneumonia and should not be routinely performed (Level II evidence). However, acute and convalescent serologic testing may occasionally be useful for a retrospective confirmation of a suspected diagnosis and may be useful in epidemiologic studies. When Legionella is suspected (patients with severe CAP), measurement of urinary antigen is valuable, being positive in the majority of patients with acute Legionella pneu-mophila serogroup 1 infection, but the test can remain positive for many months after the acute infection (81, 82). Serial complement-fixing antibody titers may be useful in monitoring patients with extensive coccidioidomycosis, and sputum cultures for endemic fungi should be collected in at-risk patients with the proper epidemiologic history. Although patients known to be immune suppressed are excluded from this statement, HIV testing should be done (after informed consent) in any CAP patient with risk factors and should be considered in any patient aged 15-54 yr who is admitted for CAP (83). Specialized tests that measure microbial antigens by monoclonal antibodies, DNA probes, and polymerase chain reaction amplification are being developed, but have not been shown to be valuable for routine use in patients with CAP.\n\nA number of invasive diagnostic techniques to obtain lower airway specimens, uncontaminated by oropharyngeal flora, have been described (45, 84, 85). These include transtracheal aspiration, bronchoscopy with a protected brush catheter, bronchoalveolar lavage with or without balloon protection, and direct percutaneous fine needle aspiration of the lung. These procedures are not indicated in most patients with community-acquired pneumonia (Level III evidence). It may be desirable to have an early accurate diagnosis in occasional patients who are severely ill, although retrospective data have shown that with severe illness, outcome is not improved by establishing a specific etiologic diagnosis (20, 24). In such patients, bronchoscopy with a protected brush catheter or bron-choalveolar lavage has a reasonable sensitivity and specificity when performed correctly. These procedures carry less risk and are usually more acceptable to patients and physicians than transtracheal aspiration and direct needle aspiration of the lung, although some physicians have special expertise in using ultrathin needles for direct lung aspiration.\n\nAlthough the committee recommended limited initial diagnostic testing, it is necessary to do more extensive testing in patients whose illness is not resolving in spite of apparently appropriate empiric therapy (see below). As discussed above, this statement is not directed at patients known to be immune suppressed. Such patients require a different and more extensive diagnostic approach that reflects the wide range of potential pathogens in this population.\n\nTHE ROLE OF CLINICAL SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS IN PREDICTING THE MICROBIAL ETIOLOGY OF CAP\n\nThe clinical features of CAP (symptoms, signs and radiographic findings) cannot be reliably used to establish the etiologic diagnosis of pneumonia with adequate sensitivity and specificity (Level II evidence). Although, in some circumstances, clinicians can confidently use clinical features to establish a specific etiologic diagnosis, in the majority of cases this is not possible. This relates not only to variations in virulence factors of particular pathogens, but also to the presence of coexisting illnesses, resulting in an overlap of clinical symptoms among various etiologic pathogens.\n\nTypical versus Atypical Pneumonia Syndromes\n\nOriginally, the classification of pneumonia into \"atypical\" and \"typical\" forms arose from the observation that the presentation and natural history of some patients with pneumonia were different compared with those of patients with pneumococcal infection (86, 87). Some pathogens, such as H. influenzae, S. aureus, and gram-negative enteric bacteria, caused clinical syndromes identical to those produced by S. pneumoniae (88). However, other pathogens caused an \"atypical\" pneumonia syndrome that was initially attributed to M. pneumoniae (87), but other bacterial and viral agents have been identified that can produce a subacute illness indistinguishable from that caused by M. pneumoniae (89, 90). Some of these agents, however, like Legionella species and influenza, can cause a wide spectrum of illness, ranging from a fulminant life-threatening pneumonia to a more subacute presentation (90). Thus the term \"atypical\" pneumonia represents a clinical syndrome that includes diverse entities, and has limited clinical value.\n\nThe attribution of specific clinical features to an etiologic agent is a common clinical practice, particularly for patients suspected of having pneumonia caused by Legionella species. However, data have cast doubt on the specificity of these observations (4, 15, 18), leading to the conclusion that the diagnosis of Legionella sp. infection could not be made on clinical grounds alone. Other comparative studies involving both pediatric and adult populations, have concluded that an etiologic diagnosis could not be established by clinical criteria alone (91-93). In addition, no roentgenographic pattern is sufficiently distinctive to allow classification of individual cases (94, 95).\n\nAdvanced age and coexisting illness are important factors that affect the clinical presentation of pneumonia. Individuals over the age of 65 yr are particularly at risk for mortality from bacteremic pneumococcal disease, and among the elderly, the tion, to make a specific etiologic diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia (Level II evidence).\n\nTHE DECISION TO HOSPITALIZE PATIENTS WITH COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA\n\nThe initial site-of-care decision is perhaps the single most important clinical decision made by physicians during the entire course of illness for patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). It has a direct bearing on the intensity of laboratory testing, microbiologic evaluation, antibiotic therapy, and costs of treating this illness. The estimated average cost of inpatient care for CAP is U.S. $7,500, compared with U.S. $150-$350 for outpatient care (2, 98).\n\nDefining Risk Factors for a Complicated Course of CAP to Determine the Need for Admission\n\nStudies have identified a series of risk factors that increase either the likelihood of death or the risk of a complicated course for community-acquired pneumonia (10, 72). When multiple risk factors coexist, the committee believed that hospitalization should be strongly considered (Level II evidence). The decision to hospitalize is not necessarily a commitment to long-term inpatient care but, rather, a decision that certain patients should be observed closely until it is clear that therapy can be safely continued out of the hospital. The admission decision may also be influenced by the availability of outpatient support services (home nursing, home intravenous therapy), and alternative sites for care (subacute care facilities). Since criteria for admission have not been uniformly applied by clinicians, studies have reported wide geographic variation in hospital admission rates for CAP (99). In addition, in some studies physicians have overestimated the risk of death for patients with CAP, leading to unnecessary admissions, while in other studies they have failed to recognize patients as being severely ill at the time of initial evaluation (72, 80).\n\nRisk factors associated with an increased risk of death or a complicated course have been identified, and in one study, admitted patients had a mean of five risk factors present (57). All of these studies were observational, and the risk factors for an adverse outcome were defined only in hospitalized patients who had received antibiotics and supportive care for their illness, and the risk factors have not been studied in large numbers of outpatients. These factors include a number of features listed below, and those with an asterisk (*) are factors that have been identified to predict mortality in the PORT prediction rule model (72):\n\n1. Age over 65 yr\n\n2. Presence of coexisting illnesses such as chronic obstructive lung disease, bronchiectasis, malignancy (*), diabetes melli-tus, chronic renal failure (*), congestive heart failure (*), chronic liver disease (*), chronic alcohol abuse, malnutrition, cerebrovascular disease (*), and postsplenectomy. A history of hospitalization within the past year is also a risk factor\n\n3. Certain physical findings also predict either mortality, increased morbidity, or a complicated course (10,79,80,100). These physical findings include a respiratory rate 30 breaths/min (*); diastolic blood pressure 60 mm Hg or an absolute neutrophil count below 1 109/L b. PaO2 60 mm Hg (*) or PaCO2 of 50 mm Hg while breathing room air\n\nc. Evidence of abnormal renal function, as manifested by serum creatinine of 1.2 mg/dl or a BUN of 20 mg/ dl ( 7 mM) (79)\n\nd.Presence of certain unfavorable chest radiograph findings, for example, more than one lobe involvement, presence of a cavity, rapid radiographic spreading (which usually cannot be determined at the time of admission) (8); and the presence of a pleural effusion (*) (78) e. Hematocrit of 30% (*) or hemoglobin 9 mg/dl f. Evidence of sepsis or organ dysfunction as manifested by a metabolic acidosis, or coagulopathy g. Arterial pH 7.35 (*)\n\nSocial considerations also enter into the decision to hospitalize. The absence of a responsible caregiver in a stable home situation is a strong indication for hospitalization, at least for observation purposes. Since community-acquired pneumonia remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, the committee felt that the admission decision remains an \"art of medicine\" decision. Thus, when the overall appearance of the patient seems unfavorable, even if the above-mentioned criteria are not fully met, consideration should be given to placing the patient in the hospital on observation status for 24 to 48 h, or until such time as these concerns are resolved (Level III evidence). In studies where objective criteria for admission have been applied, at least 30% of \"low-risk\" patients have been admitted, reflecting the need to hospitalize some patients who do not meet objective standards (101) (Level I evidence).\n\nUsing Prognostic Scoring Systems to Define the Admission Decision\n\nThe above-described approach is not quantitative, and in the past 10 years, multiple studies have used multivariate analysis to develop prediction rules for outcome in CAP that could be used to help with the initial site of care decision (72, 102-104). However, none of these rules was specifically designed to define need for hospitalization. One approach, developed by the British Thoracic Society (BTS) Research Committee, was aimed at identifying high-risk patients who not only usually require admission, but who also often require ICU care (79, 80). The other approach, developed by the Pneumonia Patient Outcomes Research Team (PORT), separated patients into high and low risk of death, and that categorization has been extrapolated into defining the need for admission (72). These two prediction rules, developed and validated in different ways, are complementary. The BTS rule is focused on identifying high-risk patients so that their severity of illness is not underestimated, while the Pneumonia PORT approach is focused on recognizing some patients as low risk, so that their severity of illness is not overestimated.\n\nThe Pneumonia PORT prediction rule used a derivation cohort of 14,199 inpatients with CAP; it was independently validated in 38,039 inpatients with CAP and in 2,287 inpatients and outpatients prospectively enrolled in the Pneumonia PORT cohort study (72). One limitation in the derivation of this rule was that it included mostly patients seen in a hospital emer- gency department, and included few outpatients who were evaluated in a physician's office and sent home. In applying this rule, patients were stratified into five severity classes, using a two-step process that evaluated a number of demographic factors, comorbid illnesses, physical findings, and laboratory and radiographic data. In the derivation and validation of this rule, mortality ranged from 0.1 to 0.4% in Class I, 0.6 to 0.7% in Class II, and 0.9 to 2.8% in Class III. Mortality was intermediate for Class IV (8.2 to 9.3%) and high for Class V (27.0 to 31.1%). Increasing risk class was also associated with subsequent hospitalization among individuals initially managed as outpatients and with need for ICU admission (72).\n\nOn the basis of these observations, the Pneumonia PORT investigators hypothesized that patients in risk Class I or II be considered for outpatient treatment. Patients in risk Class III were potential candidates for outpatient treatment or brief inpatient observation, while traditional inpatient care should be provided for patients in Classes IV and V. No attempt was made to use risk stratification for the purpose of defining the need for admission to the ICU. Using this approach, they estimated that the proportion of patients receiving traditional inpatient care could be reduced by 31%. Of the Pneumonia PORT inpatients who would have been recommended for outpatient care under this strategy, 1% died and 4.3% were admitted to an ICU (72). If the strategy were amended to include traditional inpatient care for any patient (including those in low risk groups) with arterial hypoxemia (PO2 60 mm Hg or O2 saturation 90% on room air) at the time of presentation, then the reduction in inpatient care would have been slightly less dramatic, but the number of ICU admissions, for inpatients who were initially recommended for outpatient care, would have been reduced.\n\nWhile the authors have extrapolated these data to define the need for hospitalization, the Pneumonia PORT prediction rule was actually derived to define mortality risk. In addition, it was never prospectively tested, during its development, for the purpose of defining the need for hospitalization. Prospective studies of the utility of the rule for deciding initial site of care of patients presenting to an emergency department (ED) have been published (101, 105). In one study, application of the Pneumonia PORT rule reduced the percentage of low-risk patients who were admitted (compared with a preceding control year) from 58 to 43%, but 9% of patients who were initially discharged according to the rule subsequently required admission (105). In another study conducted in 19 Canadian hospitals, 9 hospitals were randomized to use a critical pathway for pneumonia care that included calculation of the Pneumonia PORT severity index when patients arrived in the emergency department (101). Although the pathway recommended that patients in risk categories I-III be discharged, physician decision was allowed to supersede this guideline. In the hospitals that used the critical pathway, the number of low-risk patients admitted was significantly lower than in the hospitals that did not use the pathway. However, even with the use of the Pneumonia PORT rule, 31% of low-risk patients were admitted (compared with 49% in the control group). The patients in the critical pathway hospitals had the same outcome as those in the control hospitals. Since the pathway contained many interventions, the impact of any one factor (such as the Pneumonia PORT prediction rule) was not evaluated.\n\nThe BTS prediction rule was derived using 453 inpatients with CAP and was independently validated in 246 inpatients (79). The rule defines a patient as high risk for mortality if at least two of three features are present: respiratory rate 30/ min, diastolic blood pressure 60 mm Hg, and BUN 7.0 mM ( 19.1 mg/dl). Patients with two or more of these prognostic factors had a relative risk of death of 21.1 (19.4 versus 0.9%) and 9.1 (28.6 versus 3.1%) in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively. A fourth factor, confusion, has been added to the rule and in one study, patients with any two of these four factors present had a 36-fold increase in mortality compared with those without these findings (80). In addition, in that study, when calculated on admission, the BTS rule identified as severely ill 19 patients who subsequently died, while clinicians identified only 12 of these 19 as being severely ill, based on their clinical assessment. These data suggest a value for the BTS rule to identify high-risk patients in a simple and reliable fashion (Level II evidence).\n\nRecommendations for the Admission Decision\n\nPrediction rules may oversimplify the way physicians interpret predictor variables, since each variable has a \"threshold\" for being a poor prognostic finding. Thus, in the Pneumonia PORT approach, a patient with a diastolic blood pressure of 56 mm Hg falls into the same stratification as a patient with a diastolic blood pressure of 30 mm Hg, even though the two patients have profoundly different severity of illness. In addition, the Pneumonia PORT rule assigns points in a way that heavily weights age, requiring much more severe physiologic abnormalities in young patients compared with older patients, in order to fall into a risk group requiring admission. Finally, prediction rules neglect the importance of patient preferences in clinical decision-making. This point is highlighted by the observations that the vast majority of low-risk patients with CAP do not have their preferences for site of care solicited, even though many have a strong preference for outpatient care (106).\n\nThe committee felt that mortality prediction rules should be used to support, but not replace, physician decision making. Patients may have rare conditions, such as severe neuromuscular disease or prior splenectomy, that are not included as factors in these prediction rules but that increase the likelihood of a poor prognosis. In addition, factors other than severity of illness must be considered, and patients designated as \"low risk\" may have important medical and psychosocial contraindications to outpatient care. Ability to maintain oral intake, history of substance abuse, cognitive impairment, and ability to carry out activities of daily living should be considered (Level III evidence). Thus, determination of the initial site of care remains an \"art of medicine\" decision that cannot be easily made by any of the existing prediction models.\n\nDEFINITION OF SEVERE COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA AND NEED FOR ADMISSION TO THE ICU\n\nSevere community-acquired pneumonia is an entity described in the literature in reference to patients with CAP admitted to the ICU. The incidence, etiology, prognostic factors, and outcome of these patients have been defined, and differ from those in the overall population of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Studies have shown that patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia have a distinct spectrum of etiologic agents (8, 9, 16) (Level II evidence).\n\nEarly recognition of patients with severe CAP will aid in the initiation of prompt therapy directed at the likely etiologic pathogens, a strategy associated with reduced mortality, if it leads to a clinical improvement within 72 h (20). Although there is no uniformly accepted definition of severe CAP, the original ATS guidelines identified nine criteria for severe illness, and the presence of any one was used to define severe CAP. Subsequently, several studies have shown that when only one of these criteria is used, as many as 65-68% of all admitted patients have \"severe CAP,\" indicating that the original definition was overly sensitive, and not specific (48, 57).\n\ncluded a need for mechanical ventilation, an increase in the size of infiltrates by 50% within 48 h, septic shock or the need for pressors for 4 h, and acute renal failure (urine output 80 ml in 4 h or serum creatinine 2 mg/dl in the absence of chronic renal failure). In this retrospective study, the need for ICU admission could be defined by using a rule that required the presence of either two of three minor criteria (systolic BP 90 mm Hg, multilobar disease, PaO2/FIO2 ratio 250) or one of two major criteria (need for mechanical ventilation or septic shock). When the other criteria for severe illness were evaluated, they did not add to the accuracy of predicting the need for ICU admission. With this rule the sensitivity was 78%, the specificity was 94%, the positive predictive value was 75%, and the negative predictive value was 95% (48).\n\nRecommended Definition of Severe CAP and Need for ICU Admission\n\nAlthough future prospective studies defining the need for ICU admission are still needed, the committee felt that severe CAP could be defined as the presence of two minor criteria (using only the three listed above or the five in the original ATS statement), or one major criterion (using the two listed above or the four in the original ATS statement) (Level II evidence). Other findings suggesting severe illness may also have utility, but have not been formally tested to define the need for ICU admission. These include the two (of the four) other criteria in the BTS rule (in addition to the two included in the definition of severe CAP), namely confusion and BUN 19.6 mg/dl.\n\nTREATMENT GUIDELINES FOR COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA\n\nPrinciples Underlying Antibiotic Therapy Recommendations\n\nThe purpose of these guidelines is to provide the practicing physician with a rational and manageable approach to the initial antimicrobial management of community-acquired pneumonia. By their very nature, these guidelines cannot encompass all eventualities. The approach chosen is a modification of the initial ATS guidelines, and is based, as shown in Tables 2-5, on an assessment of place of therapy (outpatient, hospital ward, or ICU), the presence of coexisting cardiopulmonary disease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure), and the presence of modifying factors (Table 1). These modifying factors have been defined from published data and include the presence of risk factors for DRSP (age 65 yr, -lactam therapy within 3 mo, alcoholism, multiple medical comorbidities, immunosuppressive illness or therapy, and exposure to a child in a day care center), the presence of risk factors for enteric gram-negatives (from a nursing home, underlying cardiopulmonary disease, underlying multiple medical comorbidities, and recent antibiotic therapy), and the presence of risk factors for P. aeruginosa (bronchiectasis, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy for 7 d within the past month, malnutrition, and chronic corticosteroid therapy with 10 mg/d) (8, 52, 68). Patient stratification should be done without viewing age alone (in the absence of comorbid illness) as a predictor of enteric gram-negative infection. Therapy recommendations have incorporated the idea that atypical patho-lected. A less aggressive and narrower spectrum approach can be used for the milder cases, and as host factors become more complex or the severity of illness increases, a more aggressive and broad-spectrum regimen is recommended.\n\nIn using this approach, several principles should be considered. First, timing of initial therapy is important, because there are data showing a reduced mortality at 30 d if hospitalized patients receive their first dose of antibiotic therapy within 8 h of arrival at the hospital (77) (Level II evidence). In addition, it is desirable to give as narrow a spectrum of therapy as possible, avoiding excessively broad antibiotic therapy, if it is not needed. This goal is easily achieved if a specific etiologic diagnosis is made, but this is impossible in at least half of all patients, and the results of many diagnostic studies are not immediately available, making relatively broad spectrum empiric therapy a necessity for most patients, initially. Still, on the basis of epidemiologic considerations, even empiric therapy can be relatively narrow spectrum, provided that the patient does not have risk factors for DRSP or enteric gram-negatives (107, 108) (Level I evidence). For all patients, there is value in using initial empiric therapy based on guidelines. This type of approach not only assures timely therapy, but can also provide coverage for the possibility of mixed bacterial and atypical pathogen infection. Data in both outpatients and inpatients have shown that empiric therapy based on the initial ATS guidelines leads to a better outcome than if nonguideline therapy is used (55-57) (Level II evidence).\n\nSeveral studies have attempted to validate treatment guidelines for CAP, for both outpatients and inpatients. Gleason and coworkers studied outpatients, and documented the value of macrolide monotherapy for patients age 60 yr and without comorbid illness, but also found that macrolide monother-apy was often effective for older patients with comorbid illness (55). Although this simple therapy, which was not recommended by the guidelines, was effective for some complex outpatients with comorbid illness, the findings did not necessarily negate the need for more broad-spectrum therapy in other outpatients with comorbid illness or advanced age. In the study, the patients who were treated according to the guidelines were few in number and were more severely ill than those treated with nonguideline therapy, and the therapy they received was primarily a -lactam or trimethoprim/sulfameth-oxizole alone, without the addition of a macrolide as recommended in Table 3 of the current guidelines. Gordon and coworkers examined nearly 4,500 patients admitted to the hospital and not the ICU, and found that therapy according to the guidelines (recommended -lactam, with or without a macrolide) led to a lower mortality than if nonguideline recommended therapy was used, although the mortality was lowest for the patients who received a macrolide plus a -lactam (57). In a Medicare study of nearly 13,000 patients, the use of a second- or third-generation cephalosporin with a macrolide (but not alone), or the use of a quinolone (primarily ciproflox-acin), were therapy regimens associated with reduced mortality, compared with all other regimens (56). These findings lend some credence to the potential importance of the role of atypical pathogens, and the need for routine therapy directed at this possibility, either by adding a macrolide to a -lactam, or by using an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone alone. Dean and coworkers documented the value of a care process model based on the ATS guidelines, for providing appropriate antibiotic prescribing advice and for reducing hospital length of stay and cost (109, 109a).\n\nAntimicrobial Choices\n\nThe fluoroquinolones have assumed an important role in the management of CAP because of the development of new agents with excellent antipneumococcal activity. The advantages of the antipneumococcal fluoroquinolones include the ability to cover gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical pathogens with a single agent, generally given once a day (110). In addition, the newer agents have comparable MIC values for pneumococci that are either penicillin sensitive or penicillin resistant, although data have shown that high-level penicillin resistance can be associated with quinolone (cipro-floxacin) resistance (61). Quinolones penetrate well into the lung, often achieving levels higher than serum levels at sites such as the epithelial lining fluid and alveolar macrophages (110). In addition, quinolones are highly bioavailable, achieving similar serum levels with oral therapy as with intravenous therapy. These features allow for certain patients with moderately severe illness to be treated with oral therapy out of the hospital and also may permit the hospitalized patient to switch rapidly from intravenous to oral therapy, allowing for an early hospital discharge. There are some studies showing that admitted patients, even with bacteremia, can be effectively treated with an oral quinolone (111, 112). In spite of these data, it may be prudent to start all admitted patients who receive a quinolone on intravenous therapy to assure adequate blood levels (Level III evidence). Since anywhere from 10 to 20% of admitted patients do not respond to initial therapy (for a variety of reasons discussed below), it may be simpler to evaluate such individuals if there is no likelihood that the nonresponse is the result of a failure to absorb the initial therapy, as could occur if it was administered orally (113, 114). Currently there are a number of new antipneumococcal fluoroquinolones available, or in development, for the therapy of CAP (110). Currently available agents (in addition to cipro-floxacin and ofloxacin) include levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, gat-ifloxacin, and moxifloxacin. Trovafloxacin is restricted globally because concerns about toxicity, and gemifloxacin is in development. Among the available and widely used new agents, only levofloxacin and gatifloxacin are currently available both intravenously and orally, while the other two agents are available only orally, but intravenous formulations of moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin are being developed. Drug-related toxicity has limited the usefulness of some of these agents, with some drugs having more class-related toxicities than others. These include photosensitivity (a particular problem with sparfloxacin) and gastrointestinal upset and neurotoxicity (seizures, lightheadedness). Severe liver toxicity has been reported with trovafloxacin, and as a result its use has been virtually halted. This effect, which can theoretically occur with any quinolone, seems more common with this particular agent, but was not evident in registration trials or in early clinical experience, suggesting the need to monitor all new agents for this possible effect (110, 115) (Level III evidence). Among the currently available agents, the MIC values for pneumococcus vary from 0.12 to 2.0 mg/dl, with the agents having antipneumococcal activity in the following order (most active to least active): moxifloxacin gatifloxacin sparflox-acin levofloxacin (61,110). Gemifloxacin is more active in vitro against S. pneumoniae than moxifloxacin and gatifloxa-cin (61). Differences in the in vitro activity of these agents do not yet appear to have clinical impact, since all approved agents have documented efficacy in CAP (110, 115-117). The differences seen with in vitro activity may lead to different rates of resistance and clinical success in the future, if pneumococcal resistance to these agents becomes more common, but more data are needed.\n\nThe CDC has developed recommendations for empiric antibiotic therapy of CAP, if DRSP is likely (60). This statement emphasized the efficacy of older agents for the therapy of CAP, even in the presence of DRSP, and suggested that fluo-roquinolones be considered as second choice agents for CAP, an opinion that the committee did not accept (see below). However, if DRSP is likely, the CDC group has identified a number of active -lactam agents that can be used for initial empiric therapy, if the organism has a penicillin MIC of 2 mg/L, which include oral therapy with cefuroxime (alternatively cefpodoxime), high-dose amoxicillin (1 g every 8 h), or amoxicillin/clavulanate (875 mg twice daily); intravenous therapy with cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin/sulbactam; or, alternatively, a new antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone could be used (60) (Level II and III evidence). Other agents that are generally active in vitro against these organisms include cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem, and meropenem, but all of these agents are also active against P. aeruginosa, and are not recommended as primary therapy of CAP, since they provide broader coverage than is necessary, unless risk factors for P. aeruginosa are present (severe CAP, and some patients from nursing homes). If pneumococcal MIC values to penicillin are at 4 mg/L or greater, then the committee recommends that therapy should be with a new antipneumococcal fluoro-quinolone, vancomycin, or clindamycin (Level III evidence). At the current time, all of the approved quinolones have efficacy in CAP and one agent, levofloxacin, is approved for CAP due to DRSP. However, in the future, it may be necessary to choose the most active quinolone (lowest pneumococcal MIC values) available, because data show that penicillin-resistant pneumococci can also be resistant to quinolones, particularly those agents with the highest MIC values (ciprofloxacin, levo-floxacin), and preliminary reports of levofloxacin failures for pneumococcal pneumonia have appeared (61, 117, 118).\n\nThe committee felt that vancomycin should have a limited role, particularly for empiric therapy (60). If DRSP is suspected, other agents, as listed in Tables 2-5, will be effective, and vancomycin should be reserved for patients with high level resistance who are failing other therapies, or for those with suspected meningitis (Level III evidence). The empiric regimens for hospitalized patients do not specifically target S. aureus, but this pathogen should be considered in patients with CAP following influenza infection, and in those with a compatible sputum Gram's stain. Most of the initial therapy regimens are adequate against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, and methicillin resistance is not common in CAP, making empiric vancomycin therapy unnecessary. However, in patients with severe CAP, coming from a nursing home known to harbor this organism, empiric vancomycin can be considered as part of initial empiric therapy. Several new therapies may have efficacy for CAP due to DRSP. Linezolid is available intravenously and orally and has efficacy against pneumococcus, including DRSP. The ketolides (the first agent being studied is telithromycin) have good in vitro activity against DRSP and may be an oral therapy option for outpatients at risk for infection with this organism.\n\nAlthough high rates (up to 61%) of in vitro macrolide resistance can coexist with penicillin resistance, there are few reports of macrolide failures in CAP due to drug-resistant pneumococci and these agents should be effective for organisms with penicillin MIC values of 2.0 mg/L (60a, 119). This may be the result of the high degree of macrolide penetration into respiratory secretions, and other relevant tissue sites of infection. In addition, most macrolide resistance in North America (but not all parts of Europe) is due to an efflux mechanism, and not a ribosomal mechanism, with the efflux mechanism being associated with substantially lower MIC values than the ribosomal mechanism (119). In addition, in the regimens listed in Tables 2-5, macrolides are used alone only in the absence of risks for DRSP and enteric gram-negatives, and if these risks are present, macrolides are used as part of a combination regimen with one of the -lactams that is highly active against DRSP. There have been case reports of a few patients with macrolide-resistant pneumococcal bacteremia requiring hospitalization after oral therapy with a macrolide, but most of these patients would not have been candidates for macrolide monotherapy, according to the recommendations in Tables 2- 4, and some of these patients received this oral therapy for nonpneumonia indications (119a-119c).\n\nCertain agents that should not be used if DRSP is suspected, because of a possible lack of efficacy, include first-generation cephalosporins, cefaclor, loracarbef, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxizole.\n\nTherapy Recommendations\n\nIn each patient category listed in Tables 2-5, the committee has recommended specific therapy options. In each category, several choices for empiric therapy have been provided, and when possible, the committee recommended a more narrow-spectrum empiric therapy, such as a macrolide alone, particularly if the patient has no risks for DRSP, aspiration, or enteric gram-negatives (107, 108). In Tables 2-5 there are multiple alternative therapies, and if there is no particular order of preference, this is stated in tables. For more complex patients, the scheme usually involves the choice between a -lactam/mac-rolide combination or monotherapy with a new antipneumo-coccal fluoroquinolone. Clinical studies have shown that either approach is effective and safe, and it is unclear that there is an advantage to choosing one regimen over another (Level II evidence). The members of the consensus panel recommend that when choosing between these options, physicians consider using both approaches in different patients, in order to avoid the selection pressure for resistance that would follow from using one antibiotic approach for all patients. This recommendation (Level III evidence) has not been tested and needs further study.\n\nOutpatient therapy. If the patient has no cardiopulmonary disease, and no risks for DRSP, aspiration, or enteric gram-negatives, then the likely organisms will be pneumococcus, atypical pathogens, respiratory viruses, and possibly H. influ-enzae (especially in cigarette smokers). For these patients (Group I, Table 2) therapy should be with an advanced generation macrolide, with doxycycline as a second choice (because of less reliable activity against pneumococcus) for patients who are allergic or intolerant of macrolides. The committee felt that broader spectrum coverage with a new antipneumo-coccal fluoroquinolone would be effective, but unnecessary, and if used in this setting could promote overusage of this valuable class of antibiotics (Level III evidence). If H. influen-\n\nzae is not likely, because the patient is a nonsmoker without cardiopulmonary disease, any macrolide could be used, including erythromycin. However, the advanced generation mac-rolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin) have a lower incidence of gastrointestinal side effects than erythromycin and are administered less frequently (once or twice daily) than erythromycin, improving the likelihood of patient compliance with therapy (120). Although clarithromycin is not as active in vitro against H. influenzae as azithromycin, clinical experience with both azithromycin and clarithromycin in CAP has been favorable. This may be explained by the excellent concentrations of macrolides achieved in the epithelilal lining fluid and alveolar macrophages, and by the predominance of the efflux mechanism of pneumococcal resistance in North America.\n\nThe more complex outpatient (Group II, Table 3) can be managed with either a -lactam/macrolide combination or monotherapy with an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone (Level II evidence). Doxycycline can be used, along with a -lactam, as an alternative to a macrolide for these patients. For many patients, the ease of using one drug once daily will make the quinolone option more appealing, and in some instances less expensive. The oral -lactam should be one of the agents that is likely to be effective if DRSP is present (listed in Table 3 and above), and the agent should be used in an adequate dose, as discussed above. If ampicillin is used, it does not provide adequate coverage of H. influenzae, and thus should be combined with either an advanced generation macrolide (not erythromycin) or doxycycline. One -lactam option that can be used is parenteral (intravenous or intramuscular) once-daily ceftriaxone along with a macrolide or doxycycline. The parenteral -lactam can be switched to oral therapy after 1-2 d, provided the patient is showing an appropriate clinical response. If the patient has aspiration risk factors, or is living in a nursing home, anaerobes should be covered and this can be achieved with amoxicillin/clavulanate or amoxicillin (still combined with a macrolide). If anaerobes are documented, or if a lung abscess is present, clindamycin or metronidazole should be incorporated into the therapy regimen.\n\nInpatient therapy. For the admitted patient with cardiopulmonary disease, and/or risk factors for DRSP or enteric gram-negatives, therapy can be with either a -lactam/macrolide combination or monotherapy with an antipneumococcal fluo-roquinolone (Group IIIa, Table 4a) (Level II evidence). If risks for DRSP are present, the -lactam should be one of the selected agents listed above. When a -lactam is used in these patients, it is not used alone, but combined with a macrolide to provide coverage for atypical pathogen infection (Level II evidence). The macrolide can be given either orally or intravenously, depending on the severity of illness of the patient (121). Doxycycline can be used for the patient who is allergic or intolerant to macrolides. If the patient has risk factors for aspiration, or is living in a nursing home, anaerobes should be covered by using either ampicillin/sulbactam, high-dose ampicillin, or other active -lactams. For the admitted patient, if anaerobes are documented, or if a lung abscess is present, clin-damycin or metronidazole should be added to the regimen. For the admitted patient not in the ICU, without risks for DRSP or enteric gram-negatives and without cardiopulmonary disease (Group IIIb, Table 4b), there are data to suggest the efficacy of intravenous azithromycin alone; however, few admitted patients are likely to fall into this category (Level II evidence). The dose of intravenous azithromycin is 500 mg daily for 2-5 d, followed by oral therapy at 500 mg daily for a total of 7-10 d, and this therapy has been effective for admitted patients with CAP, including those with pneumococcal bacteremia (107, 108). If the patient is macrolide allergic or intolerant, then therapy should be with doxycycline and a -lactam, or with an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone alone. Although one study has reported that doxycycline is a cost-effective monotherapy for admitted patients with CAP (122), the study has many limitations, and the committee did not feel that this monotherapy option should be used. In addition, there was concern that with widespread use, pneumococcal resistance could emerge more rapidly to doxycycline than to other agents, and the photosensitivity associated with this agent may limit its use in some geographic areas.\n\nFor the patient with severe illness, therapy should be directed against pneumococcus, Legionella (and other atypi-cals), and H. influenzae, but patients should be stratified on the basis of whether risks for P. aeruginosa are absent or present (Group IVa, Table 5a; and Group IVb, Table 5b) (Level III evidence). In the absence of pseudomonal risk factors, therapy should be with a -lactam that would be active against DRSP plus either azithromycin or a quinolone (Group IVa, Table 5a). Erythromycin was not recommended for this group because of difficulties in administration and tolerance. When a -lactam is used in this population (Group IVa, Table 5a) and in the patients included in Group IIIa, (Table 4a), the agent should be active against DRSP, but agents that are also active against P. aeruginosa (cefepime, piperacillin/tazobac-tam, imipenem, meropenem) are not recommended as primary therapy when this organism is not suspected (Level III evidence). The role of antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone mono-therapy in severe CAP is currently uncertain. The published clinical trials have generally involved few patients admitted to the ICU, and the proper dosing and efficacy of the new quino-lones for severe CAP is unknown. There are data with cipro-floxacin (400 mg every 8 h) showing efficacy in severe CAP, but the number of patients studied is small (123). Until more data become available, the committee suggests that if quinolo-nes are used for severe CAP, they be used as a replacement for a macrolide, and be part of a combination regimen, usually with a -lactam (Level III evidence). The addition of a -lactam will also assure adequate therapy of pneumonia complicated by meningitis, since the efficacy of quinolone monother-apy in this setting is unknown. If pseudomonal risk factors are present (Group IVb, Table 5b), therapy should include two antipseudomonal agents, and provide coverage for DRSP and Legionella. This can be done with selected -lactams (cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem, meropenem) plus an an-tipseudomonal quinolone (ciprofloxacin), or with selected -lactams plus an aminoglycoside and either azithromycin or a nonpseudomonal quinolone (Level III evidence). If the patient is at risk for P. aeruginosa and is also -lactam allergic, aztre-onam can be used in place of the -lactams listed above, and should be combined with a regimen that includes an aminogly-coside and an antipneumococcal fluoroquinolone.\n\nDURATION OF THERAPY, RESPONSE TO THERAPY, AND SWITCH TO ORAL THERAPY\n\nDuration of Treatment\n\nSurprisingly few data exist to define the optimal duration of therapy for CAP and standard textbooks provide little specific referenced information about this issue. In the past, standard therapy has been 7-14 d, but new agents with a long serum or tissue half-life have been developed, which shorten the duration of drug administration. Clinical trials are being conducted with old and new agents to examine the optimal duration of therapy in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Studies are being designed to examine courses of therapy for 5-7 d among outpatients, and for 7-10 d for inpatients (124). Short treatment courses may also be possible with the 15-member mac-rolide, azithromycin. This agent has a half-life of 11 to 14 h, compared with 1.5 to 3 and 3.8 h for erythromycin and clarithromycin, respectively (120). Azithromycin remains in the tissues longer than most agents, so that reduced length of treatment based on the number of days of oral ingestion of the drug is misleading. Trials comparing oral azithromycin for 5 d with erythromycin and with cefaclor for 10 d in the treatment of pneumonia due to \"atypical pathogens\" and bacterial pathogens, respectively, suggest that shorter courses with this agent may be used (125, 126). Trials of intravenous azithromy-cin in CAP have reported a duration of therapy of 7-10 d, while 7 d of therapy may be possible with some of the new an-tipneumococcal fluoroquinolones (107, 108, 110, 116, 117). Recommendations. The presence of coexisting illness and/ or bacteremia, the severity of illness at the onset of antibiotic therapy, and the subsequent hospital course should be considered in determining the duration of antibiotic therapy. Generally, S. pneumoniae pneumonia, and other bacterial infections, should be treated for 7 to 10 d, and there are no data showing that a longer duration of therapy is needed for bacteremic patients, provided that the patient has had a good clinical response. Patients with M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae may need longer therapy ranging from 10 to 14 d. Immunocompetent patients with Legionnaire's disease should receive treatment for 10-14 d, whereas patients chronically treated with corticosteroids may require 14 d, or longer, of therapy (Level III evidence).\n\nExpected Clinical Course and Response to Therapy\n\nDuration of therapy and the early switch to oral therapy for hospitalized patients are decisions that are based on patients responding to therapy in an expected and appropriate fashion. Failure to respond as expected should lead to other diagnostic and therapeutic considerations (see below). The expected response of the hospitalized patient with CAP falls into three different periods: the first, starting with the initiation of appropriate parenteral therapy, lasts 24-72 h and during this time the patient becomes progressively more clinically stable; the second period typically starts by Day 3, with the patient having clinical stability demonstrated by improvement in signs, symptoms, and laboratory values; the third period is one of recovery and resolution of abnormal findings. Delay in the onset of clinical improvement can result from host or pathogen factors, and at any point clinical deterioration can occur. In general, with increasing patient age, multiple coexisting illnesses, and increasing severity of disease, the resolution of clinical signs and symptoms will be delayed (Level II evidence) (127-133). Other factors associated with delayed resolution include alcoholism, multilobar pneumonia, and bacteremia (127,128). Clinical deterioration usually occurs early, within the first 3 d, and a pattern of improvement and then deterioration is unusual and often the result of deep-seated infection (empyema) or an intercurrent process.\n\nIn individuals who are otherwise healthy, fever can last for 2-4 d, with defervescence occurring most rapidly with S. pneu-moniae infection, and slower with other etiologies (21, 129, 130). Leukocytosis usually resolves by Day 4, while abnormal physical findings (crackles) persist beyond 7 d in 20-40% of patients. Abnormal findings on chest radiograph clear more slowly than do clinical signs of pneumonia. For those less than 50 yr old, and otherwise healthy, S. pneumoniae pneumonia will clear radiographically by 4 wk in only 60% of patients (128,131). If the patient is older, has bacteremic pneumonia, COPD, alcoholism, or underlying chronic illness, radiographic clearing is even slower, and only 25% will have a normal radiograph at 4 wk (131). Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection can clear radiographically more rapidly than pneumococcal infection, while pneumonia due to Legionella sp. will clear more slowly (94).\n\nThe radiograph often worsens initially after therapy is started, with progression of the infiltrate and/or development of a pleural effusion. If the patient has mild or moderate pneumonia or is showing an otherwise good clinical response, this radiographic progression may have no significance. However, radiographic deterioration in the setting of severe community-acquired pneumonia has been noted to be a particularly poor prognostic feature, highly predictive of mortality (8). Recommendations for management based on clinical response. On the basis of the clinical response to therapy, patients may be categorized into three groups: (1) patients with early clinical response; (2) patients with lack of clinical response, which should be defined at Day 3 of hospitalization; and (3) patients with clinical deterioration, which can occur as early as after 24-48 h of therapy. Those falling in the first category should be considered for rapid switch to oral therapy, followed by prompt hospital discharge (Level II evidence). Patients in the second and third categories need an evaluation of host and pathogen factors, along with a reevaluation of the initial diagnosis and a search for complications of pneumonia and pneumonia therapy (see below). Because of the natural course of treatment response, antibiotic therapy should not be changed within the first 72 h, unless there is marked clinical deterioration or if bacteriologic data necessitate a change (Level III evidence) (132, 132a). In the setting of severe pneumonia, radiographic deterioration, along with accompanying clinical deterioration, may signify inadequately treated infection, and thus aggressive evaluation and a change in antimicrobial therapy may be necessary, even before 72 h of therapy has elapsed (Level III evidence).\n\nWhen to Consider Switch to Oral Therapy\n\nThe decision to switch from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy is based on an assessment of clinical response, evaluating symptoms of cough, sputum production, dyspnea, fever, and leukocytosis. Once the patient has clinically stabilized, switch to oral therapy can be achieved, and up to half of all patients are eligible on hospital Day 3 (132). Some studies have shown that early switch to oral therapy can reduce hospital length of stay, and may even improve outcome, compared with prolonged intravenous therapy (132, 132a). If the patient meets appropriate criteria for switch therapy, oral antibiotics can be started, even if the patient had a positive blood culture (133). Bacteremic patients may take longer to meet criteria for switch therapy than nonbacteremic patients, but once criteria are met the switch can be safely accomplished, unless the organism is S. aureus, in which case the patients need a longer duration of therapy to prevent or treat endocarditis.\n\nAnother issue to consider is whether it is necessary to maintain the same drug levels with oral therapy as were achieved with intravenous therapy. Agents that achieve comparable serum levels either intravenously or orally, defined as \"sequential\" therapy, include doxycycline, linezolid, and most quinolones (120). With the -lactams (penicillin, cephalosporins) and macrolides, the switch to oral therapy is associated with a decrease in serum levels, compared with intravenous therapy, and this is defined as \"step-down\" therapy. Good clinical success has been documented with either a sequential or a step-down approach (124, 132).\n\nRecommendations. Patients should be switched to oral therapy if they meet four criteria: improvement in cough and dyspnea, afebrile ( 100 F) on two occasions 8 h apart, white blood cell count decreasing, functioning gastrointestinal tract with adequate oral intake (132, 132a). However, if the overall clinical response is otherwise favorable, it may not be necessary to wait until the patient is afebrile before making the switch to oral therapy (Level II evidence) (132a, 133). In selecting an oral antibiotic for switch therapy, a specific agent, based on organism sensitivity patterns, can be chosen if the etiologic pathogen is known. In this instance the narrowest spectrum agent with an appropriate pharmacokinetic profile should be chosen; however, the issue of possible atypical pathogen coinfection should be considered. In most instances, a specific pathogen is not identified and the oral therapy should continue the spectrum of the intravenous agents used (Level III evidence). Compliance is a key issue with oral therapy and thus agents should be chosen with a minimum of side effects, and with dosing either once or twice daily, factors that increase the likelihood that the patient will complete a full course of therapy (134). Patients should also be instructed to avoid potential drug-drug interactions and to avoid antacids and certain foods that could interfere with drug absorption.\n\nHospital Discharge\n\nPatients who reach clinical stability for their pneumonia and are switched to oral therapy may still require hospitalization because of unstable coexisting illnesses, such as diabetes or congestive heart failure. Patients may also need therapy for life-threatening complications such as cardiac arrhythmia, and for management of social needs, such as an unstable home situation (135, 136).\n\nA repeat chest radiograph early in the hospital stay is unlikely to show marked improvement, even if the patient has a good clinical response. Some patients may have an abnormal chest radiograph due to slow radiographic clearing, without clinical significance, but radiographs should be followed until a new stable baseline is achieved (128). An evaluation is needed if the chest radiograph fails to return to normal, especially in a patient without complete resolution of clinical signs and symptoms (138).\n\nRecommendations. In the absence of any unstable coexisting illnesses, or other life-threatening complications, the patient should be discharged home the same day that clinical stability occurs and oral therapy is initiated. In-hospital observation on oral therapy is not necessary, and only adds to cost and length of stay, without any measurable clinical benefit (Level II evidence) (132a, 136). There is no need to repeat a chest radiograph prior to hospital discharge in a patient who is clinically improving. A repeat radiograph is recommended during a follow-up office visit, approximately 4 to 6 wk after hospital discharge, to establish a new radiographic baseline and to exclude the possibility of malignancy associated with CAP, particularly in older smokers (128, 137) (Level III evidence).\n\nMANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WHO DO NOT RESPOND ADEQUATELY TO INITIAL THERAPY\n\nIf the patient's clinical findings are not improving or are deteriorating after initial empiric therapy, consideration must be given to several possible causes. If the patient is not clinically stable by Day 3, and if host factors associated with a delayed response are present, continued therapy, without an antibiotic change, is appropriate. If, however, the patient has no explanation for a slow response, if there is no response after 7 d of therapy, or if there is clinical deterioration after 24 h of therapy, a careful re-evaluation to identify treatable causes is necessary (Level III evidence). The common etiologies for clinical deterioration fall into the following four categories.\n\nInadequate Antimicrobial Selection\n\nThe etiologic organism may be resistant to the drug(s) used in the initial empiric regimen (i.e., not covered by the initial antibiotic therapy). For example, the therapies outlined above are not optimal for S. aureus, and an aggressive search for this pathogen should be undertaken in the patient who worsens on the above-described regimens. Although empiric therapy for\n\nDRSP is recommended only for patients with risk factors, it is possible for a patient without identified risk factors to be infected with DRSP and fail to respond to empiric therapy with a recommended regimen. If the patient has risk factors for P. aeruginosa, this organism may fail to respond to a recommended empiric therapy regimen. Alternatively, the infection could be caused by an agent that is not responsive to antimicrobials of any type (i.e., a virus). Another possible explanation is that the responsible pathogen was initially sensitive to the antibiotics used, but has now become resistant, and thus organism sensitivities on both the initial (if obtained) and repeat sputum cultures should be checked.\n\nUnusual Pathogens\n\nAn additional consideration is that the patient may have community-acquired pneumonia caused by an unusual organism. Such infections should be considered when clinical and radiographic findings persist (chronic pneumonia), and the differential diagnosis includes tuberculosis, endemic fungal pneumonia (such as coccidioidomycosis), and P. carinii pneumonia. In addition, some patients may have a \"relapsing\" pneumonia, which appears to improve and then deteriorates. This situation should lead to consideration of unusual pathogens, including tuberculosis and nocardiosis. Although a discussion of the immunocompromised and/or HIV-infected patient is not included in this statement, it is possible that a patient will have one of these conditions, even though this was not initially suspected. Patients who receive corticosteroids have been reported to develop community-acquired fungal pneumonia (139).\n\nA careful repeat of the history is essential in the patient who is not improving, and certain epidemiological clues related to animal exposures and travel may suggest specific pathogens that can be detected with special serologies or cultures (Table 6). Q fever (C. burnetii) may follow exposure to parturient cats, cattle, sheep, or goats. Tularemia can occur with exposure to infected rabbits, and ticks. Psittacosis may occur after exposure to avian sources of infection; and plague or leptospirosis can follow exposure to rats. Anaerobes due to aspiration should be considered if the patient has a history of alcoholism, injection drug use, nursing home residency, neurologic illness, or any other cause of impaired consciousness. Travel to Southeast Asia can be complicated by infection with Burkholderia (Pseudomonas) pseudomallei, while Paragonimiasis can be acquired in Asia, Africa, or Central and South America. A history of tuberculosis exposure and prior tuberculin skin test status should also be elicited. If the skin test for tuberculosis has not been done and the patient is in an epidemiological risk group, it should be applied, and sputum collected for tuberculosis staining and culture. Other unusual pathogens that can lead to a syndrome of CAP include mycobacteria other than tuberculosis, endemic fungi (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis), Pasteurella multocida, Bacillus anthracis, Actinomyces israeli, Francisella tularensis, Leptospira spp., Nocardia spp, Rhodococcus equi, Yersinia pestis (plague), and hantavirus.\n\nComplications of Pneumonia\n\nIn addition to the diagnoses considered above, the patient who remains ill in spite of empiric therapy may have extrapulmo-nary complications of pneumonia. Up to 10% of patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia can have metastatic infections, which include meningitis, arthritis, endocarditis, pericarditis, peritonitis, and empyema (140). Particularly because of concern about empyema, any patient with an inadequate clinical response to therapy should have a repeat chest radiograph, and possibly a CT scan, and any pleural fluid should be sampled, cultured, and analyzed for cell count and chemistry. A CT scan can also support the diagnosis of the presence of a lung abscess, which can complicate certain forms of pneumonia. A spinal fluid examination or echocardiogram may be necessary to rule out meningitis or endocarditis. In addition to metastatic infection, several noninfectious extrapulmonary complications of pneumonia can delay radiographic clearing. These include renal failure, heart failure, pulmonary embolus with infarction, and acute myocardial infarction. Finally, if the patient has developed severe sepsis from pneumonia, the chest radiograph and clinical course may deteriorate because of the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple system organ failure. A late complication of CAP, nosocomial pneumonia, can also complicate the illness and lead to an apparent nonresponse to therapy.\n\nNoninfectious Illness\n\nA final consideration is the group of noninfectious diseases that can mimic pneumonia and initially be misdiagnosed as infection. These include pulmonary embolus, congestive heart failure, obstructing bronchogenic carcinoma, lymphoma, in-trapulmonary hemorrhage, and certain inflammatory lung diseases (bronchiolitis obliterans and organizing pneumonia, Wegener's granulomatosis, sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, acute interstitial pneumonitis, drug-induced lung disease, and eosinophilic pneumonia).\n\nEvaluation and Testing\n\nWhen a patient is not improving after initial empiric therapy, it is necessary to consider the value of certain tests for a patient who is already taking antibiotics. For example, nonresponse while receiving antibiotic therapy may indicate the possibility that a resistant, or superinfecting, pathogen is present. However, antibiotics can also decrease the utility of invasive diagnostic methods such as bronchoscopy, which has a high false-negative rate when performed while the patient is receiving antibiotics, although if organisms are recovered by this method, they are often resistant to current antibiotic therapy (141).\n\nOne study examined the utility of bronchoscopy in patients who failed empiric therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (142). Therapeutic failures were defined as early (no clinical response within 72 h) or late (initial improvement, but deterioration after 72 h). The incidence of such failures was relatively low, 6.5% of 277 patients having early failure, and 7% having late failure. Bronchoscopy was done when failure occurred, and provided diagnostically useful information in 41% of cases. Bronchoscopy, even in the presence of antibiotics, led to such diagnoses as Legionella sp. infection, anaerobic pneumonia, infection with resistant or unusual pathogens, and tuberculosis. In addition, bronchoscopy can diagnose other infections, including those caused by fungi and P. carinii, and it may be useful in detecting mechanical factors that are delaying resolution, such as an aspirated, obstructing foreign body or an obstructing endobron-chial lesion. Another study evaluated the utility of bronchoscopy in patients with persistent radiographic and clinical abnormalities (138). In that study, bronchoscopy did yield specific diagnoses, but this occurred primarily in nonsmoking patients, less than age 55 yr, who had multilobar infiltrates of long duration. Those who were older, those who have smoked, and those with focal infiltrates had a much lower yield of a specific diagnosis (other than slowly resolving pneumonia) with fiberoptic bronchoscopy.\n\nAn open lung biopsy is most useful for defining noninfectious processes in the immunocompetent patient, but may also detect tuberculosis, fungal infections, and other infectious causes. Fortunately, in the setting of CAP, open lung biopsy is rarely needed, and in one study was shown to generally provide little information to improve patient outcome (143).\n\nRecommendations for Evaluating the Nonresponding Patient\n\nBronchoscopy is usually not needed, and patience is necessary to observe the full course of radiographic clearing of community-acquired pneumonia (Level III evidence). However, bronchoscopy should be considered in patients below the age of 55 yr, who have multilobar disease and are nonsmokers. If bronchoscopy is performed, the goal is to identify unusual organisms or drug-resistant pathogens, but the clinician could also obtain this information by collecting lower respiratory tract secretions (sputum or endotracheal aspirate) for culture. Cultures should be sent to evaluate for drug-resistant and unusual pathogens, including tuberculosis.\n\nIn addition to sampling lower respiratory tract secretions, other tests should be considered. Computed tomography may reveal unsuspected collections of pleural fluid, multiple lung nodules, or cavitation within a lung infiltrate. Lung scanning, spiral CT scanning, and/or pulmonary angiography should be considered if the patient is at risk for pulmonary embolus with infarction. While the routine use of serologic testing is not useful in the initial evaluation of patients with community-acquired pneumonia, serologic tests for Legionella sp., Mycoplasma pneumoniae, viral agents, endemic fungi, and other unusual pathogens should be considered at this point. Le-gionella urinary antigen testing should also be considered. This test is positive in more than half of all patients with proven Le-gionella pneumophila infection, and more than 80% of patients with Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 infection (81, 82).\n\nIf this extensive diagnostic evaluation has not been useful, and if the patient is seriously ill, open lung biopsy of an involved area of lung should be considered (Level III evidence).\n\nVACCINATION RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE PATIENT AT RISK FOR COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA\n\nAppropriate patients at risk for CAP should be vaccinated with both pneumococcal and influenza vaccine, both of which have been shown to be safe and effective (Level I and II evidence). Cigarette smoking is a risk factor for pneumonia, and smoking cessation, particularly in patients who have had pneumonia, remains an important preventive strategy for CAP.\n\nPneumococcal Vaccine\n\nThe current vaccine contains the purified capsular polysaccharide from the 23 serotypes that cause 85-90% of the invasive pneumococcal infections in adults and children in the United States (144). Both Pneumovax and PneuImmune are effective in preventing invasive illness (bacteremia, meningitis, or infection of other normally sterile sites) caused by the included serotypes. The vaccine is both cost-effective and potentially cost saving among individuals over the age of 65 yr for the prevention of bacteremia (145, 146). Efficacy has been inconsistently demonstrated in placebo-controlled trials in patients with chronic illness, but the case-control methodology has documented effectiveness in the range of 56-81% (147-149). Efficacy has also been documented by serotype prevalence studies for bacteremic illness, but not for nonbacteremic pneumonia. The benefits of vaccination have been shown in specific patient groups, and have ranged from 65 to 84% effectiveness in such populations as persons with diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic pulmonary disease, and anatomic as-plenia (148, 149). In immunocompetent patients over the age of 65 yr, effectiveness has been documented to be 75%. In the immunocompromised patient, effectiveness has not been proven, and this includes patients with sickle cell disease, chronic renal failure, immunoglobulin deficiency, Hodgkin's disease, lymphoma, leukemia, and multiple myeloma (148, 149).\n\nThe vaccine in its current form leads to an antibody response that declines over 5-10 yr. When the vaccine is given, approximately half of all patients develop mild, local side effects such as pain at the injection site, erythema, and swelling, which last for less than 48 h. Moderate systemic reactions such as fever and myalgia are uncommon, as are more severe local reactions (local induration). No episodes of neurologic illness (Guillain-Barré syndrome) have been reported with the vaccine. A transient increase in HIV replication, of unknown significance, can occur after vaccination in HIV-infected persons. A new conjugated polysaccharide vaccine has been licensed for children. It induces a T cell-dependent response that leads to more prolonged immunologic memory.\n\nRecommendations for use. All immune-competent patients aged 65 yr or greater should be immunized (149, 150). Persons age 64 yr or less should be immunized if they have chronic illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease (congestive heart failure), chronic pulmonary disease (COPD, but not asthma), diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, chronic liver disease (cirrhosis), cerebrospinal fluid leaks, and functional or anatomic asplenia; or if they are living in special environments or social settings (Alaskan natives, certain American Indian populations, those in long-term care facilities) (Level II evidence). To facilitate these recommendations, persons over age 50 yr should have their vaccination status and risk factors reviewed when they see their primary care physician.\n\nThe efficacy in immunosuppressed patients is less certain, although we recommend that vaccination be given to these populations, which include persons with HIV infection, leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, generalized malignancy, chronic renal failure, or nephrotic syndrome, and persons receiving immunosuppressive therapy (including long-term steroids). If immunosuppressive therapy is being contemplated, vaccination should be given at least 2 wk before, if possible.\n\nA single revaccination is indicated in a person who is age 65 yr who initially received the vaccine 5 yr earlier and was age 65 yr of age on first vaccination. If the initial vaccination was given at age 65 yr or older, a repeat is not indicated. If the patient has anatomic or functional asplenia, revaccination is indicated if the patient is 10 yr of age and the second dose is given at least 5 yr after the original dose. In the immunocompromised patient populations listed above, a repeat vaccination after 5 yr is also indicated.\n\nTo improve the rate of vaccination, evaluation of candidates should occur in health care provider offices, in outpatient clinics, and in the hospital prior to discharge for virtually any medical illness. Hospital-based immunization for most admitted patients could be highly effective, since more than 60% of all patients with CAP have been admitted to the hospital, for some indication, in the preceding 4 yr, and hospitalization could be defined as an appropriate time for vaccination (151, 152) (Level III evidence). Pneumococcal vaccine can be given simultaneously with other vaccines such as influenza vaccine, but each should be given at a separate site.\n\nThe Health Care Financing Agency has approved the use of standing orders to give the vaccine to Medicare patients, and roster billing has been authorized since August 1996. The codes used for vaccination include V03.82, the diagnostic code for Streptococcus pneumoniae; 90732, the CPT code for pneumococcal vaccination; and G0009, the HCPCS Level II code for administering pneumococal vaccination. The newly licensed protein-conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (Prenevar) contains only seven serotypes. It is protective against most of the serotypes that cause otitis media, pneumonia, and meningitis in children. It is now universally recommended for healthy children beginning at age 2 mo (152a). It has not been adequately tested in adults. The older polysaccharide vaccine can be used in at-risk children beginning at 2 yr of age.\n\nInfluenza Vaccine\n\nInfluenza occurs in epidemic fashion, and between 1972 and 1992 there have been 20,000 influenza-associated deaths in each of nine epidemics (153). During the same period, four of these epidemics resulted in 40,000 influenza-associated deaths. The influenza vaccine is modified annually to reflect the anticipated strains in the upcoming season, and the current vaccine contains three strains of virus: an influenza A strain (H3N2), an influenza A strain (H1N1), and an influenza B strain. The vaccine virus is grown in eggs, purified, and then inactivated, so that it is noninfectious and cannot lead to clinical infection. In adults the vaccine can be a split virus vaccine (subvirion and purified surface antigens) or a whole virus vaccine. The current manufacturers are Connaught Laboratories, Evans Medical, and Wyeth Ayerst.\n\nThe vaccine has been shown to be effective in preventing or attenuating illness in the elderly and in younger individuals, with efficacy depending on the match between the vaccine strain and the circulating strain (154-156). When the match is good, the vaccine can prevent illness in 70-90% of healthy persons aged 65 yr. For elderly persons with certain chronic illnesses, the efficacy is less, but the vaccine can still attenuate the influenza infection, leading to less frequent lower respiratory infections and the associated morbidity and mortality that follow influenza infection. Although the vaccine is less effective for older persons than for younger persons, it can prevent severe illness and death. In one meta-analysis of 20 studies, the vaccine was shown to reduce the occurrence of pneumonia by 53%, hospitalization by 50%, and mortality by 68% (154). In addition, the vaccine has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality during influenza season by 27-54% (155, 156), and has been shown to be cost-effective in multiple studies (156). Concern about side effects has limited the use of the vaccine by some patients, but the vaccine does not contain live virus and cannot lead to influenza. Reactions include local soreness at the injection site, which may last up to 2 d, and is generally mild and not disabling; systemic symptoms of fever, malaise, and myalgias beginning 6-12 h after vaccination and lasting for 1-2 d, which are not more common than with placebo (157); rare immediate allergic reactions in patients with egg hypersensitivity; and Guillain-Barré syndrome, which has been clearly associated only with the 1976 swine influenza vaccine and has not been associated with other vaccines since then (158).\n\nRecommendations for use. Target groups include those at increased risk for influenza complications, those who can transmit influenza to high-risk patients, and other special groups including any person who wishes to reduce the chance of becoming infected with influenza (159) (Level I evidence). Groups at increased risk for influenza-related complications are persons 65 yr, residents of nursing homes or chronic care facilities, patients with chronic pulmonary or cardiovascular disease, those who required regular medical care or hospitalization in the preceding year (for diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, hemoglobinopathies, or immunosuppression), and pregnant women in the second or third trimester during influenza season.\n\nThose who can transmit the illness to high-risk individuals include physicians, nurses, and other personnel in the hospital or outpatient setting; employees of nursing homes and chronic care facilities; home care providers for high-risk patients, and household members of patients in the above high risk groups. Other special groups who should consider vaccination include persons with HIV infection, breast-feeding mothers, travelers to foreign countries during influenza epidemics, those who provide essential community services, and persons who study or work in institutional settings.\n\nSince the relevant viral strain changes annually, revaccination is needed yearly, and should be given from the beginning of September through mid-November. Vaccination can be cost-effective if given to at-risk individuals during hospitalization or during routine health care, before the influenza season. Roster billing can be used in the hospital or in physician's offices, and the following billing codes can be used: V04.8, the diagnostic code for influenza virus; 90724, the CPT code for influenza virus vaccine; and G0008, the HCPCS Level II code for administering influenza virus vaccine. Vaccine programs can facilitate delivery of the vaccine and should be developed in outpatient clinics, emergency rooms, and walk-in clinics, nursing homes, outpatient facilities providing care to high-risk patients (dialysis centers), home care programs, traveler's clinics, and other health care facilities.\n\nA new, live attenuated virus vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective in children as well as healthy working adults.\n\nAntiviral Therapy and Chemoprophylaxis\n\nThe older available antiviral agents (amantadine and rimanta-dine) are active against influenza A virus, but not influenza B virus, while the new neuraminidase inhibitors-zanamivir and os-eltamivir-are active against both influenza A and B (160-162). Amantadine and rimantadine can be given as therapy for influenza and can reduce the severity and duration of illness if administered within 48 h of the onset of symptoms, but their impact on preventing influenza-related complications in high-risk patients is uncertain. These agents can be used during an institutional outbreak of influenza to treat infected persons and to serve as prophylaxis for unvaccinated individuals, and therapy is continued for 1 wk after the end of the outbreak. Antiviral prophylaxis is 70-90% effective against influenza A virus, using either amantadine or rimantadine for the duration of the epidemic in the community (160). Targets for prophylaxis are high-risk patients who have been vaccinated after the onset of the epidemic (they are treated for 2 wk only); persons caring for high-risk patients; persons with immune deficiency; persons in whom the vaccine is contraindicated; and others desiring prophylaxis of influenza A illness.\n\nAdverse reactions to amantadine include central nervous system effects (nervousness, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, lightheadedness), and gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, anorexia). The incidence of central nervous system side effects is less with rimantadine. Dosage should be adjusted for age and renal function and resistance to these agents by influenza A strains has been reported (160).\n\nThe antineuraminidase drugs, when used for treating influenza, reduce clinical illness and viral shedding by 2 d (161, 162). Their benefit is greatest when the respiratory illness is most severe. They prevent secondary complications of influenza, such as otitis media and sinusitis. They are effective for prophylaxis against both influenza A and B. Zanamivir is inhaled through the mouth with a specially provided applicator, and bronchospasm is possible, but unusual. Oseltamivir is given as a pill, is rapidly absorbed and achieves high blood levels, and is well tolerated but may lead to occasional nausea, which is prevented by taking the pill with food.\n\nComparison of the two anti-influenza drug classes shows important differences. With the antimembrane drugs (amantadine and rimantadine), resistance emerges rapidly, frequency of resistance is high, and mutant viruses are common. Neurologic side effects are often seen with these agents. With the neuraminidase inhibitors, resistance emerges slowly, the frequency of resistance is low, and the mutant virus had reduced virulence. In addition, neurologic side effects have not been reported. It is likely that the antineuraminidase drugs will be used more widely than the older antiviral agents, and these agents have been shown to be effective not only for prophylaxis, but also for the treatment of influenza A and B, if started within 36 h after the onset of symptoms (163, 164).\n\nSUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe initial approach to managing patients with community-acquired pneumonia involves a determination of the presence of relevant factors that influence the likely etiologic pathogens. These factors include place of therapy (inpatient versus outpatient), the presence of cardiopulmonary disease, the presence of risk factors for drug-resistant pneumococci, the presence of risk factors for enteric gram-negative bacteria (including P. aeruginosa), and the severity of illness at presentation (mild, moderate, or severe). Once these assessments have been made, initial antimicrobial therapy can be selected according to the recommendations in Tables 2-5, and the choices will cover the most common pathogens likely for a given clinical setting. It is important to evaluate the response to initial therapy so that patients who are not adequately improving can be identified and properly evaluated.\n\nThe approach advocated in Tables 2-5 is different from several common clinical practices that have no firm basis in published studies. The practices include the use of sputum Gram's stain to define the likely etiologic pathogen and to guide initial therapy of community-acquired pneumonia; the use of extensive diagnostic testing in the initial evaluation of etiology; and the use of clinical syndromes to predict microbial etiology.\n\nIn several important areas of management, data are limited, and recommendations are not based on a firm scientific foundation. Future studies should focus on some of these pressing, but unanswered, questions: (1) How long should therapy be continued? (2) Should duration of therapy be related to severity of initial illness? (3) What role does antibiotic resistance play in the outcome of patients with CAP and how should initial therapy be modified to account for possible resistance? (4) Will newer diagnostic methods improve our ability to define the etiologic pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia, and will this information lead to improved outcomes? (5) What are the best criteria for defining the need for hospitalization? (6) How will antibiotic choices and guidelines for empiric therapy impact future patterns of antibiotic resistance? (7) Is atypical pathogen coinfection common and if so, is it prevalent all the time, or are there temporal and geographic variables to consider?\n\nOften the distinction between pneumonia and bronchitis is uncertain, since even the chest radiograph may not be sensitive to early forms of pneumonia. This document is focused on the management of CAP, but the role of antibiotic therapy in patients with AECB needs further study, with a particular focus on whether specific types of antibiotic therapy should be targeted to specific patient populations. However, for CAP, the committee believes that guidelines can be useful for initial patient manage-\n\nMICHAEL S. NIEDERMAN, M.D., Co-chair LIONEL A.

It can affect people of any age, but often starts in childhood. It is characterised by attacks (also known as exacerbations) of breathlessness and wheezing, with the severity and frequency of attacks varying from person to person. The attacks are associated with variable airflow obstruction and inflammation within the lungs, which if left untreated can be life-threatening, however with the appropriate treatment can be reversible. </p><p>The World Health Organization estimates that 235 million people have asthma worldwide, and it is the most common chronic condition to affect children. In the UK, 4.1 million people get treatment for asthma. </p><p>The causes of asthma are not well understood. A number of risk factors are associated with the condition, often in combination. These influences can be genetic (the condition clusters in families) and/or environmental (such as inhalation of allergens or chemical irritants). Occupational causes of asthma in adults are often under-recognised. </p><p>There is currently no gold standard test available to diagnose asthma; diagnosis is principally based on a thorough history taken by an experienced clinician. It is therefore not surprising that studies of adults diagnosed with asthma suggest that up to 30% do not have clear evidence of asthma. Some may have had asthma in the past, but it is likely that many have been given an incorrect diagnosis. The typical wheeze found in a person with asthma is a continuous, polyphonic whistling sound produced in the airways during expiration and is related to obstruction of the airways on breathing out. Expiratory polyphonic wheeze is a characteristic clinical symptom and sign in people with asthma or other obstructive airways diseases. </p><p>Initial clinical assessment should include questions about symptoms (wheezing, cough, breathing and chest problems) and any personal or family history of allergies, atopic disorders or asthma. Various tests can be used to support a diagnosis, but there is no single test that can definitively diagnose asthma. </p><p>A number of methods and assessments are available to determine the likelihood of asthma. These include measuring airflow obstruction (spirometry and peak flow) and assessment of reversibility with bronchodilators, with both methods being widely used in current clinical practice. However, normal results do not exclude asthma and abnormal results do not always mean it is asthma, as they could be indicators of other respiratory diseases or spurious readings. </p><p>Testing for airway inflammation is increasingly used as a diagnostic strategy in clinical practice. This includes measuring fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). However, there is some uncertainty about both the sensitivity and specificity of FeNO, particularly as to whether it can distinguish general atopy from asthma. </p><p>Other diagnostic strategies include blood or skin prick tests to detect allergic reactions to environmental influences, exercise tests to detect evidence of bronchoconstriction, and measures of airway hyper-reactivity such as histamine/methacholine or mannitol challenge tests. However, it is debatable which test or measure, or combination of them, is the most effective to accurately diagnose asthma. </p><p>It is recognised that asthma control is suboptimal in many people with asthma. This has an impact on their quality of life, their use of healthcare services and the associated costs. Asthma control can be monitored by measuring airway obstruction or inflammation and by using validated questionnaires, but the most effective monitoring strategy is unclear. </p><p>The aim of this guideline is, therefore, to determine the most clinical and cost-effective way to effectively diagnose people with asthma and determine the most effective monitoring strategy to ensure optimum asthma control. </p><p>The scope of this guideline covers the diagnosis and monitoring of asthma and excludes other aspects of management. This is because there is evidence that incorrect diagnosis is a significant problem. </p><p>This guideline covers infants and young children 0-5 years old, children 5-16 years old and adults over the age of 16 who are being investigated for suspected asthma, or who have been diagnosed with asthma and are having their condition monitored. The guideline applies to all primary, secondary and community care settings in which NHS-funded care is provided for people with asthma. </p><p><b><i>Medicine recommendations </i></b></p><p>The guideline will assume that prescribers will use a medicine's summary of product characteristics to inform decisions made with individual patients. </p><h3><p>Patient-centred care </p></h3><p>This guideline offers best practice advice on the care of adults, young people and children with suspected asthma or with a confirmed diagnosis of asthma. </p><p>Patients and healthcare professionals have rights and responsibilities as set out in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-nhs-constitution-for-england\">NHS Constitution for England</a> - all NICE guidance is written to reflect these. Treatment and care should take into account individual needs and preferences. Patients should have the opportunity to make informed decisions about their care and treatment, in partnership with their healthcare professionals. If the patient is under 16, their family or carers should also be given information and support to help the child or young person to make decisions about their treatment. Healthcare professionals should follow the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/reference-guide-to-consent-for-examination-or-treatment-second-edition\">Department of Health's advice on consent</a>. If someone does not have capacity to make decisions, healthcare professionals should follow the <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/protecting-the-vulnerable/mental-capacity-act\">code of practice that accompanies the Mental Capacity Act</a> and the supplementary <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http:/www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_085476\">code of practice on deprivation of liberty safeguards</a>. </p><p>NICE has produced guidance on the components of good patient experience in adult NHS services. All healthcare professionals should follow the recommendations in <a href=\"http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG138\">Patient experience in adult NHS services</a>. </p><p>If a young person is moving between paediatric and adult services, care should be planned and managed according to the best practice guidance described in the Department of Health's <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http:/www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publicationsandstatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/DH_4132145\">Transition: getting it right for young people</a>. </p><p>Adult and paediatric healthcare teams should work jointly to provide assessment and services to young people with suspected or confirmed asthma. Diagnosis and management should be reviewed throughout the transition process, and there should be clarity about who is the lead clinician to ensure continuity of care. </p><h3><p>Strength of recommendations </p></h3><p>Some recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline Development Group makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the Guideline Development Group is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation). </p><p>For all recommendations, NICE expects that there is discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits of the interventions, and their values and preferences. This discussion aims to help them to reach a fully informed decision (see also 'Patient-centred care'). </p><p><b><i>Interventions that must (or must not) be used </i></b></p><p>We usually use 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally we use 'must' (or 'must not') if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening. </p><p><b><i>Interventions that should (or should not) be used - a 'strong' recommendation </i></b></p><p>We use 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when we are confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. We use similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer…') when we are confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients. </p><p><b><i>Interventions that could be used </i></b></p><p>We use 'consider' when we are confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time </p><p>considering and discussing the options with the patient. </p><h3><p>Key priorities for implementation </p></h3><p>The following recommendations have been identified as priorities for implementation. The full list of recommendations is in section 1. </p><p><b>Diagnosing asthma: Initial clinical assessment </b></p><p>• Check for suspected occupational asthma by asking employed people with newly-diagnosed asthma or established asthma that is poorly controlled: </p><p>• are symptoms better on days away from work? </p><p>• are symptoms better when on holiday1? </p><p>Make sure all answers are recorded for later review. <b>[1.1.7]</b> </p><p><b>Diagnosing asthma: Objective tests </b></p><p>• Use spirometry as the first-line investigation for asthma in adults and young people older than 16 and children aged 5-16 years.

The draft guideline recommends that a diagnosis of asthma in adults and children over 5 years should not be based on the results of any single diagnostic test or spirometry alone. In relation to this, if the draft recommendations are not changed after consultation we think that the 3 most important and challenging areas to implement will be: </p><p>• using spirometry [recommendations 1.2.1, 1.2.2] </p><p>• FeNO challenge testing [recommendations 1.2.9, 1.2.10] </p><p>• bronchial challenge testing [recommendations 1.2.12, 1.2.13]. </p><p>During consultation we want stakeholders to let us know if you agree with these choices, or if you would give priority to other areas. We would also like you to send us suggestions of ways that these challenges could be addressed - such as by sharing examples of good practice, or by letting us know about existing educational materials or other resources. This information will be used to write an implementation section for the final guideline. </p><p>Please send us your comments and suggestions using the comments form. </p><h3><p>Factors affecting implementation </p></h3><p><b><i>Spirometry </i></b></p><p>Spirometry equipment is already available and in use in primary care. It is mainly used to diagnose chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although it is cost effective, it is not usually used to help diagnose asthma as the benefits of doing so may not be well known by GPs. At present, when it is used there may be variation in investigation standards and the subsequent interpretation of results. </p><p>Using spirometry in children aged 5-16 years is a significant change in practice and will be practically challenging if a child does not want or is unable to cooperate. Healthcare professionals using this investigation will need to develop the knowledge and skills to use it effectively with children, and encourage children to cooperate with them. </p><p>Also, primary care professionals may need to improve their skills in interpreting spirometry results for both adults and children, so that they are better informed when deciding the next step in the diagnosis pathway or identifying what medication to offer. </p><p><b><i>FeNO challenge testing </i></b></p><p>FeNO challenge testing has only recently been introduced in primary care, and the availability of FeNO testing equipment is patchy. A business case aimed at those responsible for commissioning and assessing the testing will need to be developed to support investment in new equipment and to provide education and training in its use for primary care professionals. </p><p><b><i>Bronchial challenge testing </i></b></p><p>The recommendations on bronchial challenge testing [recommendations 1.2.12, 1.2.13] are a significant change to the diagnostic pathway. This test is only usually available in secondary and tertiary care, and it is likely only a few primary care professionals will have access to it at present. Adding this test to the new diagnostic pathway will mean that people eligible to be offered it can be referred by primary care professionals. It is important that healthcare professionals with this new referral responsibility are aware of the benefits of the test and its place in the new diagnostic pathway, in order to ensure appropriate referral and effective diagnosis. Implementation of these recommendations is likely to increase referrals for this test. Commissioners and trusts will need to work together to respond to this change in referral pathways and increased demand in a cost-effective way. </p><h3><p>3 Research recommendations </p></h3><p>The Guideline Development Group has made the following recommendations for research, based on its review of evidence, to improve NICE guidance and patient care in the future. The Guideline Development Group's full set of research recommendations is detailed in the full guideline. </p><p><b><i>3.1 Diagnosing asthma in children aged 5-16 years </i></b></p><p>What is the acceptability and diagnostic accuracy of objective tests that could be used to comprise a diagnostic pathway for asthma in children aged 5-16 years old (for example, exercise challenge, direct bronchial challenge with histamine or methacholine, indirect bronchial challenge with mannitol and peripheral blood eosinophil count)? </p><p><b>Why this is important </b></p><p>Asthma is a common condition, diagnosed in nearly 1 in 10 children. There are no validated and reliable objective criteria for diagnosing asthma, so the vast majority of asthma diagnoses are currently based on symptoms and signs. However, symptoms and signs consistent with a diagnosis of asthma are not specific to the condition and can be present in other illnesses. This diagnostic uncertainty results in many children being incorrectly diagnosed with asthma, and many children with asthma in whom the diagnosis is delayed or missed. A single objective measure, or set of objective measures, that can be performed easily in non-specialist clinical settings (although it is noted that challenge tests need to be performed in specialist settings) will help improve diagnostic certainty and reduce the proportion of children treated inappropriately for asthma. This would ensure that children with the condition are identified and treated early. </p><p><b><i>3.2 Diagnosing asthma in adults and young people older than 16 </i></b></p><p>What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of using an indirect bronchial challenge test with mannitol to diagnose asthma in adults and young people older than 16? </p><p><b>Why this is important </b></p><p>Chronic airway inflammation is associated with bronchial hyper-responsiveness, which is integral to defining asthma. Bronchial challenge testing can help diagnose asthma and assess response to inhaled corticosteroid therapy. It can also be used to monitor asthma control, alongside assessing symptoms and lung function. It is increasingly used in asthma management, although currently most tests are performed only in specialised centres or research settings. </p><p>Indirect challenge tests with inhaled mannitol act via active inflammatory cells and mediators, whereas direct challenge tests with inhaled histamine or methacholine act directly on bronchial smooth muscle. Indirect challenge testing is more specific but less sensitive than direct challenges. </p><p>Direct challenge testing may not identify a person who will respond to inhaled steroids. A positive result to an indirect challenge may reflect active airway inflammation that is likely to respond to inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Because a response to mannitol indicates active airway inflammation, identifying non-responsiveness in treated patients may help demonstrate good asthma control with inhaled corticosteroid therapy and identify people less likely to deteriorate after a dose reduction. </p><p>Mannitol bronchial challenge testing is quicker and simpler than current direct tests (which are generally confined to specialist respiratory centres), and uses a standardised inhaler device, so is potentially more useful in primary care. </p><p><b><i>3.3 Monitoring adherence to treatment </i></b></p><p>What is the clinical and cost effectiveness of using electronic alert systems designed to monitor and improve adherence with regular inhaled maintenance therapy in people with asthma? </p><p><b>Why this is important </b></p><p>Adherence with regular maintenance inhaled corticosteroids, on their own or in combination with long-acting beta agonists, is of paramount importance to achieve control of asthma and prevent asthma attacks. Published evidence in patients with severe asthma suggests that at least 30% of patients are partially or non-adherent with their prescribed medications, and the Royal College of Physicians' National </p><p>Review of Asthma Deaths (NRAD)5 demonstrated that poor adherence was associated with 38% of asthma deaths. </p><p><b><i>3.4 Monitoring inhaler technique </i></b></p><p>What is the current frequency and the current method being used to check the inhaler technique of people with asthma? What is the optimal frequency and the best method of checking inhaler technique to improve clinical outcomes for people with asthma? </p><p><b>Why this is important </b></p><p>Knowing and understanding how to use an inhaler properly is the cornerstone of asthma management and symptom control. There has been an increase in the types of inhaler devices and the types of delivery system available. The various types of drugs for asthma control are also available in different inhaler devices on their own and in a combination of 2 drugs. It is therefore vital for patients to learn the proper inhaler technique for their device to ensure optimum drug delivery to the lungs for asthma control. </p><p><b><i>3.5 Monitoring asthma control using tele-healthcare </i></b></p><p>What is the long-term (more than 12 months) clinical and cost effectiveness of using tele-healthcare as a means to monitor asthma control in children, young people and adults? Modalities of tele-healthcare can include telephone interview (healthcare professional involvement) and internet or smartphone-based monitoring support (no healthcare professional involvement). </p><p><b>Why this is important </b></p><p>Asthma outcomes have not improved in the past 15 years, and the personal and economic costs of poor control are high. Computers and smartphones play an ever-greater role in modern life, with a growing proportion of people using them regularly for work, leisure, communication and information. The efficient use of distance monitoring systems and the integration of new technologies into healthcare are </p><p>5\n</p><p> Royal College of Physicians'<a href=\"https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/sites/default/files/why-asthma-still-kills-full-report.pdf\"> National Review of Asthma Deaths</a> (May 2014). </p><p>important for patients and for healthcare systems in terms of convenience, costs and outcomes. </p><h3><p>4 Other information </p></h3><p><b><i>4.1 Scope and how this guideline was developed </i></b></p><p>NICE guidelines are developed in accordance with a <a href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-cgwave0640/documents\">scope</a> that defines what the guideline will and will not cover. </p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><p><b>How this guideline was developed </b></p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><p>NICE commissioned the National Clinical Guideline Centre to develop this </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>guideline.

It can affect people of any age, but often starts in childhood. It is characterised by attacks (also known as exacerbations) of breathlessness and wheezing, with the severity and frequency of attacks varying from person to person. The attacks are associated with variable airflow obstruction and inflammation within the lungs, which if left untreated can be life-threatening, however with the appropriate treatment can be reversible.\n\nThe World Health Organization estimates that 235 million people have asthma worldwide, and it is the most common chronic condition to affect children. In the UK, 4.1 million people get treatment for asthma.\n\nThe causes of asthma are not well understood. A number of risk factors are associated with the condition, often in combination. These influences can be genetic (the condition clusters in families) and/or environmental (such as inhalation of allergens or chemical irritants). Occupational causes of asthma in adults are often under-recognised.\n\nThere is currently no gold standard test available to diagnose asthma; diagnosis is principally based on a thorough history taken by an experienced clinician. It is therefore not surprising that studies of adults diagnosed with asthma suggest that up to 30% do not have clear evidence of asthma. Some may have had asthma in the past, but it is likely that many have been given an incorrect diagnosis. The typical wheeze found in a person with asthma is a continuous, polyphonic whistling sound produced in the airways during expiration and is related to obstruction of the airways on breathing out. Expiratory polyphonic wheeze is a characteristic clinical symptom and sign in people with asthma or other obstructive airways diseases.\n\nInitial clinical assessment should include questions about symptoms (wheezing, cough, breathing and chest problems) and any personal or family history of allergies, atopic disorders or asthma. Various tests can be used to support a diagnosis, but there is no single test that can definitively diagnose asthma.\n\nA number of methods and assessments are available to determine the likelihood of asthma. These include measuring airflow obstruction (spirometry and peak flow) and assessment of reversibility with bronchodilators, with both methods being widely used in current clinical practice. However, normal results do not exclude asthma and abnormal results do not always mean it is asthma, as they could be indicators of other respiratory diseases or spurious readings.\n\nTesting for airway inflammation is increasingly used as a diagnostic strategy in clinical practice. This includes measuring fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO). However, there is some uncertainty about both the sensitivity and specificity of FeNO, particularly as to whether it can distinguish general atopy from asthma.\n\nOther diagnostic strategies include blood or skin prick tests to detect allergic reactions to environmental influences, exercise tests to detect evidence of bronchoconstriction, and measures of airway hyper-reactivity such as histamine/methacholine or mannitol challenge tests. However, it is debatable which test or measure, or combination of them, is the most effective to accurately diagnose asthma.\n\nIt is recognised that asthma control is suboptimal in many people with asthma. This has an impact on their quality of life, their use of healthcare services and the associated costs. Asthma control can be monitored by measuring airway obstruction or inflammation and by using validated questionnaires, but the most effective monitoring strategy is unclear.\n\nThe aim of this guideline is, therefore, to determine the most clinical and cost-effective way to effectively diagnose people with asthma and determine the most effective monitoring strategy to ensure optimum asthma control.\n\nThe scope of this guideline covers the diagnosis and monitoring of asthma and excludes other aspects of management. This is because there is evidence that incorrect diagnosis is a significant problem.\n\nThis guideline covers infants and young children 0-5 years old, children 5-16 years old and adults over the age of 16 who are being investigated for suspected asthma, or who have been diagnosed with asthma and are having their condition monitored. The guideline applies to all primary, secondary and community care settings in which NHS-funded care is provided for people with asthma.\n\nMedicine recommendations\n\nThe guideline will assume that prescribers will use a medicine's summary of product characteristics to inform decisions made with individual patients.\n\nPatient-centred care\n\nThis guideline offers best practice advice on the care of adults, young people and children with suspected asthma or with a confirmed diagnosis of asthma.\n\nPatients and healthcare professionals have rights and responsibilities as set out in the NHS Constitution for England - all NICE guidance is written to reflect these. Treatment and care should take into account individual needs and preferences. Patients should have the opportunity to make informed decisions about their care and treatment, in partnership with their healthcare professionals. If the patient is under 16, their family or carers should also be given information and support to help the child or young person to make decisions about their treatment. Healthcare professionals should follow the Department of Health's advice on consent. If someone does not have capacity to make decisions, healthcare professionals should follow the code of practice that accompanies the Mental Capacity Act and the supplementary code of practice on deprivation of liberty safeguards.\n\nNICE has produced guidance on the components of good patient experience in adult NHS services. All healthcare professionals should follow the recommendations in Patient experience in adult NHS services.\n\nIf a young person is moving between paediatric and adult services, care should be planned and managed according to the best practice guidance described in the Department of Health's Transition: getting it right for young people.\n\nAdult and paediatric healthcare teams should work jointly to provide assessment and services to young people with suspected or confirmed asthma. Diagnosis and management should be reviewed throughout the transition process, and there should be clarity about who is the lead clinician to ensure continuity of care.\n\nStrength of recommendations\n\nSome recommendations can be made with more certainty than others. The Guideline Development Group makes a recommendation based on the trade-off between the benefits and harms of an intervention, taking into account the quality of the underpinning evidence. For some interventions, the Guideline Development Group is confident that, given the information it has looked at, most patients would choose the intervention. The wording used in the recommendations in this guideline denotes the certainty with which the recommendation is made (the strength of the recommendation).\n\nFor all recommendations, NICE expects that there is discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits of the interventions, and their values and preferences. This discussion aims to help them to reach a fully informed decision (see also 'Patient-centred care').\n\nInterventions that must (or must not) be used\n\nWe usually use 'must' or 'must not' only if there is a legal duty to apply the recommendation. Occasionally we use 'must' (or 'must not') if the consequences of not following the recommendation could be extremely serious or potentially life threatening.\n\nInterventions that should (or should not) be used - a 'strong' recommendation\n\nWe use 'offer' (and similar words such as 'refer' or 'advise') when we are confident that, for the vast majority of patients, an intervention will do more good than harm, and be cost effective. We use similar forms of words (for example, 'Do not offer…') when we are confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients.\n\nInterventions that could be used\n\nWe use 'consider' when we are confident that an intervention will do more good than harm for most patients, and be cost effective, but other options may be similarly cost effective. The choice of intervention, and whether or not to have the intervention at all, is more likely to depend on the patient's values and preferences than for a strong recommendation, and so the healthcare professional should spend more time\n\nconsidering and discussing the options with the patient.\n\nKey priorities for implementation\n\nThe following recommendations have been identified as priorities for implementation. The full list of recommendations is in section 1.\n\nDiagnosing asthma: Initial clinical assessment\n\n• Check for suspected occupational asthma by asking employed people with newly-diagnosed asthma or established asthma that is poorly controlled:\n\n• are symptoms better on days away from work?\n\n• are symptoms better when on holiday1?\n\nMake sure all answers are recorded for later review. [1.1.7]\n\nDiagnosing asthma: Objective tests\n\n• Use spirometry as the first-line investigation for asthma in adults and young people older than 16 and children aged 5-16 years. Regard a forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio of less than 70% as a positive test for obstructive airway disease (obstructive spirometry). See also recommendation 1.2.2. [1.1.9]\n\n• Offer a bronchodilator reversibility (BDR) test to adults and young people older than 16 with obstructive spirometry (FEV1/FVC ratio less than 70%). Regard an improvement in FEV1 of 12% or more, together with an increase in volume of 200 ml or more, as a positive test. [1.1.10]\n\n• Offer a BDR test to children aged 5-16 years with obstructive spirometry (FEV1/FVC ratio less than 70%). Regard an improvement in FEV1 of 12% or more as a positive test. [1.1.11]\n\n• Offer a FeNO test in adults and young people older than 16 if a diagnosis of asthma is being considered. Regard a FeNO level of 40 parts per billion (ppb) or more as a positive test. [1.1.16]\n\n• Offer a direct bronchial challenge test with histamine or methacholine2 in adults and young people older than 16 if there is diagnostic uncertainty after a normal spirometry and either a:\n\n1\n\n'Holiday' here means any longer time away from work than usual breaks at weekends or between shifts.\n\nComment [LK1]: Will be linked in final published web viewer version.\n\n• FeNO level of 40 ppb or more and no variability in peak flow readings or\n\n• FeNO level of 39 ppb or less with variability in peak flow readings. Regard a PC20 value of 8 mg/ml or less as a positive test. [1.1.19]\n\nDiagnosing asthma in children younger than 5 years\n\n• Treat symptoms based on observation and clinical judgement in children younger than 5 years. If asthma is still suspected when the child is old enough to take part in objective tests (usually around the age of 5), perform these and review the diagnosis. [1.2.1]\n\nMonitoring asthma control\n\n• Consider using a validated questionnaire (the Asthma Control Questionnaire or Asthma Control Test) to monitor asthma control in adults and young people older than 16. [1.3.2]\n\n• Monitor asthma control at each review in adults and children aged 5 years and over using either spirometry (FEV1) or peak flow variability. [1.3.3]\n\n• Monitor the inhaler technique of people with asthma (in line with the NICE quality standard on asthma):\n\n• after every asthma attack\n\n• when the device is changed\n\n• at every annual review. [1.3.7]\n\n2\n\nAt the time of consultation (January 2015), methacholine did not have a UK marketing authorisation for this use. The healthcare professional should follow relevant professional guidance, taking full responsibility for the decision to use this test. Informed consent should be obtained and documented. See the General Medical Council's Prescribing guidance: prescribing unlicensed medicines for further information.\n\nDiagnostic algorithms\n\nDRAFT FOR CONSULTATION\n\nAsthma: NICE guideline DRAFT (January 2015) Page 11 of 37\n\nDRAFT FOR CONSULTATION\n\nAsthma: NICE guideline DRAFT (January 2015) Page 13 of 37\n\n1 Recommendations\n\nThe following guidance is based on the best available evidence. The full guideline [hyperlink to be added for final publication] gives details of the methods and the evidence used to develop the guidance.\n\n1.1 Diagnosing asthma Initial clinical assessment\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\n1.1.1 Take a structured clinical history in people with suspected asthma. Specifically, check for:\n\n• wheeze\n\n• cough\n\n• breathlessness\n\n• any variation in the above symptoms occurring over the course of 24 hours or seasonally.\n\n1.1.2 Do not use symptoms alone without an objective test to diagnose asthma.\n\n1.1.3 Physically examine people with suspected asthma to identify expiratory polyphonic wheeze and signs of other causes of respiratory symptoms, but be aware that even if examination results are normal the person may still have asthma.\n\nHistory of atopic disorders\n\n1.1.4 Ask about a personal or family history of atopic disorders. Record any triggers that make symptoms worse.\n\n1.1.5 Do not use a history of atopic disorders alone to diagnose asthma.\n\nSymptoms after exercise\n\n1.1.6 Do not use an isolated clinical history of symptoms after exercise to diagnose asthma.\n\nOccupational asthma\n\n1.1.7 Check for suspected occupational asthma by asking employed people with newly-diagnosed asthma or established asthma that is poorly controlled:\n\n• are symptoms better on days away from work?\n\n• are symptoms better when on holiday3?\n\nMake sure all answers are recorded for later review.\n\n1.1.8 Refer people with suspected occupational asthma to an occupational asthma specialist.\n\nObjective tests\n\nLung function tests\n\nSpirometry\n\n1.1.9 Use spirometry as the first-line investigation for asthma in adults and young people older than 16 and children aged 5-16 years.

The draft guideline recommends that a diagnosis of asthma in adults and children over 5 years should not be based on the results of any single diagnostic test or spirometry alone. In relation to this, if the draft recommendations are not changed after consultation we think that the 3 most important and challenging areas to implement will be:\n\n• using spirometry [recommendations 1.2.1, 1.2.2]\n\n• FeNO challenge testing [recommendations 1.2.9, 1.2.10]\n\n• bronchial challenge testing [recommendations 1.2.12, 1.2.13].\n\nDuring consultation we want stakeholders to let us know if you agree with these choices, or if you would give priority to other areas. We would also like you to send us suggestions of ways that these challenges could be addressed - such as by sharing examples of good practice, or by letting us know about existing educational materials or other resources. This information will be used to write an implementation section for the final guideline.\n\nPlease send us your comments and suggestions using the comments form.\n\nFactors affecting implementation\n\nSpirometry\n\nSpirometry equipment is already available and in use in primary care. It is mainly used to diagnose chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although it is cost effective, it is not usually used to help diagnose asthma as the benefits of doing so may not be well known by GPs. At present, when it is used there may be variation in investigation standards and the subsequent interpretation of results.\n\nUsing spirometry in children aged 5-16 years is a significant change in practice and will be practically challenging if a child does not want or is unable to cooperate. Healthcare professionals using this investigation will need to develop the knowledge and skills to use it effectively with children, and encourage children to cooperate with them.\n\nAlso, primary care professionals may need to improve their skills in interpreting spirometry results for both adults and children, so that they are better informed when deciding the next step in the diagnosis pathway or identifying what medication to offer.\n\nFeNO challenge testing\n\nFeNO challenge testing has only recently been introduced in primary care, and the availability of FeNO testing equipment is patchy. A business case aimed at those responsible for commissioning and assessing the testing will need to be developed to support investment in new equipment and to provide education and training in its use for primary care professionals.\n\nBronchial challenge testing\n\nThe recommendations on bronchial challenge testing [recommendations 1.2.12, 1.2.13] are a significant change to the diagnostic pathway. This test is only usually available in secondary and tertiary care, and it is likely only a few primary care professionals will have access to it at present. Adding this test to the new diagnostic pathway will mean that people eligible to be offered it can be referred by primary care professionals. It is important that healthcare professionals with this new referral responsibility are aware of the benefits of the test and its place in the new diagnostic pathway, in order to ensure appropriate referral and effective diagnosis. Implementation of these recommendations is likely to increase referrals for this test. Commissioners and trusts will need to work together to respond to this change in referral pathways and increased demand in a cost-effective way.\n\n3 Research recommendations\n\nThe Guideline Development Group has made the following recommendations for research, based on its review of evidence, to improve NICE guidance and patient care in the future. The Guideline Development Group's full set of research recommendations is detailed in the full guideline.\n\n3.1 Diagnosing asthma in children aged 5-16 years\n\nWhat is the acceptability and diagnostic accuracy of objective tests that could be used to comprise a diagnostic pathway for asthma in children aged 5-16 years old (for example, exercise challenge, direct bronchial challenge with histamine or methacholine, indirect bronchial challenge with mannitol and peripheral blood eosinophil count)?\n\nWhy this is important\n\nAsthma is a common condition, diagnosed in nearly 1 in 10 children. There are no validated and reliable objective criteria for diagnosing asthma, so the vast majority of asthma diagnoses are currently based on symptoms and signs. However, symptoms and signs consistent with a diagnosis of asthma are not specific to the condition and can be present in other illnesses. This diagnostic uncertainty results in many children being incorrectly diagnosed with asthma, and many children with asthma in whom the diagnosis is delayed or missed. A single objective measure, or set of objective measures, that can be performed easily in non-specialist clinical settings (although it is noted that challenge tests need to be performed in specialist settings) will help improve diagnostic certainty and reduce the proportion of children treated inappropriately for asthma. This would ensure that children with the condition are identified and treated early.\n\n3.2 Diagnosing asthma in adults and young people older than 16\n\nWhat is the clinical and cost effectiveness of using an indirect bronchial challenge test with mannitol to diagnose asthma in adults and young people older than 16?\n\nWhy this is important\n\nChronic airway inflammation is associated with bronchial hyper-responsiveness, which is integral to defining asthma. Bronchial challenge testing can help diagnose asthma and assess response to inhaled corticosteroid therapy. It can also be used to monitor asthma control, alongside assessing symptoms and lung function. It is increasingly used in asthma management, although currently most tests are performed only in specialised centres or research settings.\n\nIndirect challenge tests with inhaled mannitol act via active inflammatory cells and mediators, whereas direct challenge tests with inhaled histamine or methacholine act directly on bronchial smooth muscle. Indirect challenge testing is more specific but less sensitive than direct challenges.\n\nDirect challenge testing may not identify a person who will respond to inhaled steroids. A positive result to an indirect challenge may reflect active airway inflammation that is likely to respond to inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Because a response to mannitol indicates active airway inflammation, identifying non-responsiveness in treated patients may help demonstrate good asthma control with inhaled corticosteroid therapy and identify people less likely to deteriorate after a dose reduction.\n\nMannitol bronchial challenge testing is quicker and simpler than current direct tests (which are generally confined to specialist respiratory centres), and uses a standardised inhaler device, so is potentially more useful in primary care.\n\n3.3 Monitoring adherence to treatment\n\nWhat is the clinical and cost effectiveness of using electronic alert systems designed to monitor and improve adherence with regular inhaled maintenance therapy in people with asthma?\n\nWhy this is important\n\nAdherence with regular maintenance inhaled corticosteroids, on their own or in combination with long-acting beta agonists, is of paramount importance to achieve control of asthma and prevent asthma attacks. Published evidence in patients with severe asthma suggests that at least 30% of patients are partially or non-adherent with their prescribed medications, and the Royal College of Physicians' National\n\nReview of Asthma Deaths (NRAD)5 demonstrated that poor adherence was associated with 38% of asthma deaths.\n\n3.4 Monitoring inhaler technique\n\nWhat is the current frequency and the current method being used to check the inhaler technique of people with asthma? What is the optimal frequency and the best method of checking inhaler technique to improve clinical outcomes for people with asthma?\n\nWhy this is important\n\nKnowing and understanding how to use an inhaler properly is the cornerstone of asthma management and symptom control. There has been an increase in the types of inhaler devices and the types of delivery system available. The various types of drugs for asthma control are also available in different inhaler devices on their own and in a combination of 2 drugs. It is therefore vital for patients to learn the proper inhaler technique for their device to ensure optimum drug delivery to the lungs for asthma control.\n\n3.5 Monitoring asthma control using tele-healthcare\n\nWhat is the long-term (more than 12 months) clinical and cost effectiveness of using tele-healthcare as a means to monitor asthma control in children, young people and adults? Modalities of tele-healthcare can include telephone interview (healthcare professional involvement) and internet or smartphone-based monitoring support (no healthcare professional involvement).\n\nWhy this is important\n\nAsthma outcomes have not improved in the past 15 years, and the personal and economic costs of poor control are high. Computers and smartphones play an ever-greater role in modern life, with a growing proportion of people using them regularly for work, leisure, communication and information. The efficient use of distance monitoring systems and the integration of new technologies into healthcare are\n\n5\n\nRoyal College of Physicians' National Review of Asthma Deaths (May 2014).\n\nimportant for patients and for healthcare systems in terms of convenience, costs and outcomes.\n\n4 Other information\n\n4.1 Scope and how this guideline was developed\n\nNICE guidelines are developed in accordance with a scope that defines what the guideline will and will not cover.\n\nHow this guideline was developed NICE commissioned the National Clinical Guideline Centre to develop this guideline.

Introduction </p><p>The lung is continuously exposed to the external environment and mixtures of complex antigens through the air. It is estimated that the resting human adult inhales 12,000 liters of air per day, while even mild physical activity can double or triple this amount (1). Protective immunity against inhaled antigens is mediated by the lymphocytes that are localized to the surface of the respiratory tract. The compartments in the lung where lymphocytes are present are (i) the epithelium and lamina propria of the air-conducting regions, (ii) the bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (found commonly in certain animals i.e. rabbit and rats) (iii) the pulmonary interstitium and vascular beds (iv) the bronchoalveolar space. In addition to anatomical barriers, such as airway angulation, mucociliary clearance, and coughing, both humoral and cellular defense mechanisms play an important role in maintaining the viability of the host. One of the first lines of defense against particulate matter is mucociliary clearance and phagocytic activity of alveolar macrophages. Antigens entering the pulmonary tract encounter antigen-presenting cells comprised of alveolar and interstitial macrophages and effector T lymphocytes. </p><p>2. Bronchoalveolar lavage for diagnosis of various respiratory disorders </p><p>Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is an important tool for the diagnosis of pulmonary infections and malignancies. Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy is a relatively safe and minimally invasive means by which to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). It is usually well tolerated by patients and can be performed safely even on those patients who are quite ill. </p><p>The diagnostic and prognostic utility of BAL was first evaluated in the 1980s (2). The investigatory technique of BAL has become one of the most valuable research tools for studying inflammatory mechanisms in a wide range of diseases that affect the lungs and airways in humans. In addition, cytological and microbiological testing of BAL samples are of established value for assisting in clinical diagnosis and management of many lung diseases, and these procedures are available routinely. </p><p>Since the introduction of the rigid bronchoscope by Dr. Jackson in 1904, BAL is a diagnostic procedure in which a fiber-optic bronchoscope is passed through the mouth or nose into the lung and fluid is put into a small part of the lung and then recollected for examination. </p><p> </p><p>Bronchoalveolar lavage is typically performed to diagnose lung disease. Primarily, BAL was used as a treatment for patients who suffered from diseases associated with accumulation of purulent secretions such as alveolar proteinosis, cystic fibrosis and bacterial pneumonia (3). </p><p>3. Definition </p><p>By definition BAL is a method for the recovery of cellular and non-cellular components from the lower respiratory tract (e.g. alveoli) (4). It is a safe technique, with few major complications (5). In many cases (e.g. pulmonary proteinosis, alveolar hemorrhage, eosinophilic pneumonia) BAL can replace lung biopsy (6). Possible uses of BAL in diagnostics are summarized in following table </p><table border=\"1\"><tbody><tr><td><p>Non-infectious </p></td><td><p>Infectious </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Sarcoidosis </p></td><td><p>(Ventilator-associated) pneumonia </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hypersensitivity pneumonitis </p></td><td><p>Pneumocystis pneumonia </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Idiopatic lung fibrosis </p></td><td><p>Mycobacterial infection </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Connective tissue disorders </p></td><td><p>Aspergillus fumigatus infection </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Langerhans cell histiocytosis </p></td><td><p>Viral pneumonia </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Malignancies </p></td><td><p>Toxoplasma pneumonia </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Alveolar hemorrhage </p></td><td><p>Legionella infection </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Alveolar proteinosis </p></td><td><p>Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Eosinophilic pneumonia </p></td><td><p>Chlamydia pneumoniae pneumonia </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia </p></td><td><p>Cryptococcal infection </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Asbestosis </p></td><td><p>Histoplasma infection </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Silicosis </p></td><td><p>Strongyloides infection </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Table 1. Pulmonary diseases where BALF can be used to a diagnosis (7, 8, 9). </p><p>4. Procedure </p><p>Bronchoalveolar Lavage is a minimally invasive technique which is used to obtain cells, inhaled particles, infectious organisms and solutes from the alveolar spaces of the lung. To achieve this, a sufficient volume of lavage fluid must be instilled to ensure a sufficient aspirate. In adults, a minimum of 100 mL of lavage fluid should be instilled. Besides diagnostic BAL, there are other lavage techniques are used and they differ in the following ways: 1) Bronchial lavage (or bronchial washing) requires relatively little instilled fluid (10-30 mL) and samples from large airways for bacteriological study and/or tumour cytology; 2) therapeutic lavage usees small volumes and is used to remove sticky bronchial secretions in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis; and 3) whole lung lavage is performed in order to wash out an entire lung in patients with alveolar proteinosis, which requires repeated instillation of 1 L of fluid (in total 10-40 L for each lung) through a double-lumen endotracheal tube during general anaesthesia. </p><p> </p><p>BAL is usually performed during fibreoptic bronchoscopy with topical anaesthetic after general inspection of the tracheobronchial tree. BAL can also be performed under general anaesthesia and in ventilated patients through a rigid bronchoscope or an endotracheal tube. </p><p>5. Site of bronchoalveolar lavage </p><p>The site of lavage depends on the localization of the abnormalities. In case of localized disease, for instance an infection with a radiographically apparent infiltrate or a malignancy, the involved segment should be sampled (10). In diffuse lung disease, the middle lobe or lingular lobe is commonly used as a standard site for BAL. This is often the most accessible site and the fluid obtained at one site is representative of the whole lung in diffuse lung diseases (11). If anatomical difficulties are encountered in both lobes the anterior segment of either the upper or lower lobe may be used. Using the method described, approximately 1.5-3% of the lung (approximately 1,000,000 alveoli) are sampled (4). </p><p>Usually, the lavage is performed using sterile, unbuffered isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) solution and preferably the saline is preheated to body-temperature (37ºC) to help prevent coughing and increase cellular yield (12). The volume varies between 100 and 300 ml in aliquots of 20 to 50 ml (13). The ERS task force recommended the use of 200-240 ml divided in four aliquots. </p><p>5.1 Fluid instillation and recovery </p><p>The fluid is instilled with syringes through the biopsy channel of bronchoscope and immediately recovered by applying suction (25-100 mmHg), using a standard number of input aliquots of 20-60 mL (commonly four to five aliquots are recommended) up to a total volume of 100-300 mL. Smaller instilled volumes (&lt;100 mL) increase the likelihood of contamination by the bronchial spaces, including inflammatory cells derived from the larger airways, which may skew the differential cell counts [14]. </p><p>The first aspirated volume is normally smaller than the following ones. Usually, 40-70% of the instilled volume is recovered. In obstructive airway disease and emphysema the recovery rate is significantly lower and may be &lt;30%. The yield is also reduced in healthy smokers and the elderly. In addition, fluid recovery may be low with a poor wedge position leading to leakage of lavage fluid around the bronchoscope, which is associated with cough. Differential evaluation of the ''bronchial'' (first aliquot) and ''alveolar'' (subsequent aliquots) samples may be useful in airway diseases. Siliconised or plastic containers should be used for collection and processing of BAL fluid to avoid loss of cells through adhesion to glass surfaces. </p><p>6. Safety aspects </p><p>The BAL procedure is practically associated with no mortality and carries a low complication rate of 0-2.3% [15-17]. After BAL procedure there is fever in some hours and a transient decrease in lung function parameters, both usually self-limited and resolving within 24 h. These are the most frequent adverse effects and occur in 3-30% of patients, depending on the instilled volume. Other adverse effects include short-lasting alveolar infiltration, wheezing and bronchospasm in patients with hyper-reactive airways. Major or late complications are only seen in patients with severe lung or heart disease, and bleeding has only been reported in patients with clotting disorders or thrombocytopenia. Risk factors for developing adverse effects are: 1) extensive pulmonary infiltrates, an arterial oxygen tension &lt;8.0 kPa (&lt;60 mmHg) and an oxygen saturation &lt;90%; 2) a forced expiratory volume in 1 s &lt;1.0 L; 3) prothrombin time >50 s and platelet counts &lt;20,000 platelets/mL; 4) significant comorbidity; and 5) bronchial hyperreactivity. </p><p> </p><p>6.1 Quality control of BALF </p><p>To ensure that the obtained material represents the situation in the alveoli, a number of criteria have been established. A BALF is regarded non-representative if it fulfills one of the following criteria: i) volume &lt;20 ml, ii) total cell count &lt;60,000 cells/ml, iii) presence of >1% squamous epithelial cells, iv) presence of >5% bronchial epithelial cells, v) presence of extensive amounts of debris, vi) severely damaged cell morphology. </p><p>6.2 Specimen processing </p><p>The total fluid recovered is kept at room temperature and should be transported to the laboratory within 1 hr because the cells are not well preserved in the saline solution. The fluid should be pooled into a single container and total volume should be measured. The lavage fluid frequently contains large amounts of mucus; therefore, filtration through cotton gauze or nylon mesh is often performed. Filtration leads to a preferential loss of bronchial epithelial cells without a significant effect on the total cell count and cell differentials. After filtration, the fluid is centrifuged for 10 min at 500g and after this the supernatant can be stored at -20°C or -70°C for subsequent analysis of soluble components. The total number of cells is counted in a haemocytometer, either in a sample of the pooled native fluid or in a resuspension of the cells after the first centrifugation. Washing procedures result in a loss of total cell count but lead to an increase in cell viability of the remaining cells. The total cell count is usually expressed as the total number of cells recovered per lavage but also as the concentration of cells per mL of recovered fluid. Cell viability is assessed by trypan blue exclusion and should range from 80% to 95% [18, 19]. </p><p>For the enumeration of cell differentials, at least 600 cells are counted on cytocentrifuge or cell smear preparations after staining with May-Grunwald-Giemsa stain. A high percentage of epithelial cells (>5%) is indicative of contamination of the alveolar samples by bronchial cells. At least three unstained slides should be stored so that special stains (iron, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), silver, toluidine blue, fat or Ziehl-Neelsen) can be performed as per need. </p><p>Besides these routine investigations, further work-up can be performed as needed. For example, if a tumor is suspected the Papanicolau stain can be applied. If infection is suspected, a complete microbiological assessment, including cultures, should be performed. To document asbestos exposure, quantitative determination of asbestos bodies can be made after vacuum filtration of the native BAL fluid through a 0.45-1.2 µm Millipore membrane. The exact dust composition can be determined by electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry. Lymphocyte subpopulations can be identified by immunocytochemical methods, immunofluorescence or flow cytometry using monoclonal antibody techniques [20]. </p><p> </p><p>These investigations are not recommended as a routine procedure for all BAL specimens. They are indicated in cases with high lymphocyte counts, such as extrinsic allergic alveolitis, or if Langerhans cell histiocytosis is suspected CD3. CD4, CD8, CD20 and markers of T-cell activation can be determined. CD1a or Langerin are very specific markers of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Flow cytometry is also a useful tool to detect markers of malignant lymphoma [21]. </p><p>There are some studies also performed for research purposes including functional studies of viable BAL cells, cell cultivation in appropriate culture medium and determination of mediators along with the mechanisms that appear to regulate the mediator release. Cells can also be probed with molecular biology to investigate gene activation and intracellular signaling pathways. </p><p>7. Normal values of BAL in healthy volunteers </p><p>The BAL fluid obtained from healthy, nonsmoking adults without lung disease contains only small percentages of lymphocytes, neutrophils and other inflammatory cells; alveolar macrophages are the predominant cell population (80-90%) (fig. 1a). Differential cell count in healthy non-smokers have been reported to show macrophages >80%, lymphocytes ≤15%, neutrophils ≤3%, eosinophils ≤0.5%, and mast cells ≤0.5%. </p><p> (a) (b) </p><p>Fig. 1. Bronchoalveolar lavage in a) a healthy nonsmoker and b) a healthy smoker [22]. </p><p> </p><p>Cigarette smoking is a strong confounding factor with significant effects on BAL samples. The alveolar macrophages from smokers show a 3 to 5 fold increase and characteristic morphology: many of them are much larger than those in nonsmokers and contain cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (smoker's inclusion bodies) consisting of tar products, lipids, lipofuscin and other substances (fig. 1b). </p><p>7.1 BAL in the diagnosis of diffuse parenchymal lung disease </p><p>BAL is indicated in every patient with nuclear pulmonary shadowing or interstitial lung disease (ILD). BAL findings may be very specific, so that they can directly confirm a particular diagnosis. BAL should not be considered as a stand-alone diagnostic test and should be interpreted in the context of clinical, laboratory and radiographical high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings. It has been used in diagnostic and prognostic evaluation in diffuse parenchymal lung disease for three decades and has a central role in the diagnosis of a number of rare disorders and in excluding opportunistic infection in treated patients. It also has an important role in the diagnosis of many prevalent disorders, including sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. </p><p>7.2 Specific BAL findings in rare diseases </p><p>7.2.1 Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis </p><p>Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is one of the few diseases in which BAL can confirm the diagnosis and replace lung biopsy. In pulmonary alveolar protienosis the BAL fluid is macroscopically milky and turbid. Under light microscopy the characteristic acellular oval bodies (surfactant derived lipoproteins) are basophilic on May-Grunwald-Giemsa staining and positive with PAS staining. The background is occupied by large amounts of amorphous debris showing weak PAS staining and a few foamy macrophages [21]. </p><p>7.2.2 Langerhans cell histiocytosis </p><p>Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis is strongly associated with cigarette smoking, and the BAL differential shows the typical smoker's constellation with increased total cell counts and macrophages with smoker's inclusions. The specific finding is an increase in Langerhans cells to >4% of the total BAL cell count. The sensitivity is low because in late cases of the disease the number of Langerhans cells decrease in the tissue. Low proportions of Langerhans cells in the range of 2-4% can be seen in other conditions, such as in healthy smokers, respiratory bronchiolitis/interstitial lung disease (RB/ILD), other ILD and bronchioalveolar carcinoma [21]. The Langerhans cells can be easily identified in BAL by their staining with the monoclonal antibody for CD1a or Langerin [23]. The intracytoplasmic reaction with polyclonal antibody S100 is not as specific. As in alveolar proteinosis, electronic microscopy is not recommended as a routine diagnostic procedure. </p><p>7.2.3 Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage </p><p>Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) is a clinical syndrome with widespread bleeding into the alveolar space as a result of multiple causes. The demonstration of numerous haemosiderin-laden macrophages on BAL cytology enables a diagnosis to be made even in cases with occult bleeding. In patients with fresh bleeding episodes free red blood cells in the fluid and fragments of ingested red blood cells within the cytoplasm of macrophages are pathognomonic. </p><p> </p><p>To asses the severity of bleeding, the percentage of siderophages can easily be counted. It has been shown that a percentage of siderophages ≥20% is sufficient for a diagnosis of DAH. </p><p>Many syndromes belong to this group and other clinical and laboratory findings must be investigated to establish the cause of the bleeding. In the clinical setting, chronic left heart failure with pulmonary congestion is one of the most frequent underlying conditions for the finding of DAH in BAL fluid examination. Endogenous bleeding has to be differentiated from exogenous iron load of the lungs. Exogenous siderosis does not show roundish fragments of erythrocytes but irregular shaped dust particles engulfed by macrophages. </p><p>7.2.4 Chronic aspiration </p><p>In the differential diagnosis of recurrent pneumonia, gastro-oesophageal reflux with aspiration needs to be considered. The BAL cell differential may show a mixed pattern with increase in lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils. The characteristic diagnostic finding is the presence of large numbers of lipid-laden macrophages and is highly suggestive of lipoid pneumonia caused by chronic aspiration. </p><p>7.2.5 Pneumoconioses </p><p>In ILD due to mineral dust exposure, BAL can confirm exposure by the detection of dust particles in alveolar macrophages. It is of two types: </p><p>a. Asbestos-related disease: Asbestos bodies in BAL fluid can be detected by smear technique or cytocentrifuge technique. However quantification of asbestos bodies by a specific Millipore filtration is a more sensitive technique. The results are expressed as number of asbestos bodies per mL of BAL fluid, which shows a relatively good correlation with the asbestos body count in lung tissue analysis. However, 10-15% of subjects with known occupational asbestos exposure may have no detectable asbestos bodies in their BAL fluid. Thus, a negative BAL asbestos body count does not exclude asbestos-related disease. </p><p>b. Chronic beryllium disease: This condition is clinically, radiologically and histologically identical to sarcoidosis and in this condition BAL lymphocytes have an increase in the CD4/CD8 ratio . Because the antigen is known, a diagnostic in vitro lymphocyte transformation test can be performed. Lymphocytes from blood or BAL fluid are incubated with beryllium salts and the beryllium-specific proliferation of the lymphocytes is quantified. A positive lymphocyte transformation test of BAL T-cells to beryllium salts is highly sensitive and specific (definitely more sensitive than the blood test) and always recommended in doubtful cases to confirm the diagnosis. </p><p>7.2.6 Eosinophilic lung disease </p><p>Eosinophilic lung disease can be diagnosed when there are ≥25% eosinophils in BAL of the radiologically affected segment. In both acute and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia the fraction of BAL eosinophils ranges from 20% to 90% and is higher than the neutrophil fraction. In this condition a mild-to-moderate increase in lymphocyte count with a decrease in CD4/CD8 ratio can be observed. In combination with clinical and HRCT findings, eosinophilic lung diseases can be appropriately diagnosed by BAL alone without an open lung biopsy [21]. </p><p> </p><p>7.2.7 Opportunistic infections </p><p>BAL has achieved the greatest diagnostic value among immunocompromised patients with pulmonary infiltrates. The sensitivity of BAL ranges from 60-90% in the diagnosis of bacterial infections, 70-80% in mycobacterial, fungal and most viral infections, and from 90- 95% in Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. The characteristic cysts of Pneumocystis can be detected on May-Grunwald-Giemsa stained slides. </p><p>In cytomegalovirus pneumonia, the characteristic cytomegalic-transformed cell (the owl eye cell) with typical nuclear or cytoplasmic inclusions is highly specific and can be seen on light microscopy in 30-50% of cases. </p><p>7.2.8 Malignancies </p><p>BAL is not as sensitive for solid tumours as biopsy and cytology techniques. Diffuse malignant infiltrates can be reliably diagnosed in 60-90% of cases. The highest yield is seen in widespread malignancies, such as primary bronchoalveolar carcinoma or lymphangitic carcinomatosis due to adenocarcinoma. It can also provide diagnostic cytological material in haematological malignancies of the lung, including Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukaemia, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia, myeloma and mycosis fungoides. In malignant B-cell lymphoma the immunocytological demonstration of a monoclonal B-cell population, expressing only one immunoglobulin type and either kappa or lambda light chains, can confirm the diagnosis of malignancy [24, 25]. </p><p>8. BAL as an adjunct to diagnosis </p><p>There are no specific BAL findings in the more common interstitial lung diseases. However, when BAL cellular analysis is considered in the context of clinical and HRCT findings it may contribute to narrowing the differential diagnosis and to avoiding open lung biopsy. BAL cellular patterns can generally differentiate the fibrosing conditions (characterised by neutrophilia and eosinophilia) from granulomatous diseases (lymphocytosis with or without granulocytosis). </p><p>8.1 Sarcoidosis </p><p>In sarcoidosis, BAL shows lymphocytic alveolitis in 90% of patients at the time of diagnosis, independent of the stage of sarcoidosis. It was shown that the patients with active sarcoidosis have a tendency to show higher lymphocyte counts than those with inactive sarcoidosis. However, in the late stage of sarcoidosis neutrophils may also be increased, as well as the number of mast cells. Patients with primary extrathoracic sarcoidosis may show typical findings of sarcoidosis on BAL even when imaging findings are normal [26]. The CD4/CD8 ratio also has high variability in sarcoidosis and approximately only 55% of patients show an increased CD4/CD8 ratio at the time of diagnosis. The ratio is even decreased to 1.0 in 15% of patients. The CD4/CD8 ratio is especially high in patients with Lofgren syndrome and acute sarcoidosis. Some studies have demonstrated an increased neutrophil count in BAL obtained from newly diagnosed patients with sarcoidosis. </p><p> </p><p>8.2 Extrinsic allergic alveolitis </p><p>This disease shows the highest total cell count and the highest lymphocyte count of all ILD's. The total cell yield is usually >20 million from a 100-mL BAL, with the proportion of lymphocytes exceeding 50%. The number of activated T-cells is also increased. The assessment of the CD4/CD8 ratio has produced contradictory findings. It is a general belief that the CD4/CD8 ratio is decreased. However, more recent studies have demonstrated that the ratio may be decreased, normal or increased [27, 28]. The alveolar macrophages are heterogeneous and often show a foamy cytoplasm. In acute episodes of extrinsic allergic alveolitis, the neutrophil count may increase transiently for approximately one week. A normal cell appearance or an isolated increase in neutrophil or eosinophil count widely excludes extrinsic allergic alveolitis. </p><p>8.3 Drug induced pneumonitis </p><p>There are a large number of drugs which may induce an ILD, mediated by either toxic or immunological mechanisms (Table 2) [29]. Along with BAL lymphocytosis and/or granulocytosis, cytotoxic reactions with atypical type II pneumocytes or diffuse alveolar haemorrhage may be observed. The most frequent finding is lymphocytic alveolitis with a dominance of CD8+ T-cells. Methotrexate-induced pneumonitis may show an increase in CD4+ cells. Characteristic changes in amiodarone-induced pneumonitis are the presence of alveolar macrophages with a finely vacuolated foamy cytoplasm. These are also seen in patients without clinical signs of ILD. If no foamy macrophages are found, amiodarone-induced pneumonitis can probably be excluded. The BAL findings described are not specific for drug-induced lung disease; therefore, additional assessment including tests like anti-histone antibody is necessary to make the diagnosis. </p><p>8.4 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other idiopathic interstitial pneumonias </p><p>The typical BAL findings in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a moderately increased neutrophil count (10-30% of the total cells), with or without an increased eosinophil count. In total, 70-90% of the patients show an increased neutrophil count, while 40-60% shows an additionally increased eosinophil count. In 10-20% of the patients, a moderately increased lymphocyte count (proportion &lt;30%) is seen . </p><p>In nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), a BAL lymphocytosis with a mild increase in the neutrophil and eosinophil count can be seen [30]. A BAL lymphocytosis is likely to be found more frequently in cellular NSIP than in fibrotic NSIP. The BAL findings in cellular NSIP appear to resemble those in bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). </p><p>In acute interstitial pneumonia the histological finding of diffuse alveolar damage shows an extremely unfavourable prognosis. The BAL fluid in acute interstitial pneumonia is mostly bloody and rich in albumin, indicating increased alveolar capillary permeability.

Bronchoalveolar lavage findings in drug-induced interstitial lung disease </p><p>cellular BAL finding is a marked increase in neutrophils and an occasional increase in lymphocytes. Atypical pneumocytes mimicking adenocarcinoma and fragmented hyaline membranes may also be observed [25]. The typical BAL findings in desquamative interstitial pneumonia and RB/ILD are an increase in macrophages with black pigmented inclusions. In this an increase in neutrophils, eosinophils and, occasionally, lymphocytes may also be seen. Idiopathic lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia is rare and is usually associated with collagen vascular diseases, Sjogren's syndrome or lymphoma. The typical BAL finding in lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia is lymphocytosis and CD4/CD8 ratio shows diverse alterations. </p><p>8.5 Collagen vascular disease </p><p>In collagen vascular diseases (CVD), pulmonary involvement can be associated with various histopathological patterns. The pathology may be similar to IPF with a usual interstitial pneumonia pattern, but many of the cases of CVD-associated pulmonary fibrosis show a pattern that is in the category of NSIP, based on a computed tomography scan or histology [26]. The BAL findings are also somewhat different from IPF. The general pattern is increased neutrophils, with or without eosinophils, but increased lymphocytes are more commonly seen than in IPF [31]. In general, BAL seems to have a limited value in the diagnosis of CVD affecting the lungs because the BAL profile is very nonspecific. However, BAL may be useful in detecting other pulmonary problems that may arise in these disorders, including drug induced toxicity, infection, pulmonary haemorrhage associated with vasculitis and malignancy. The NSIP pattern was the more prevalent pattern. It has previously been shown that increased BAL neutrophils were associated with more extensive changes on HRCT. An abnormal BAL may be the first evidence of pulmonary involvement in CVD. If radiographic signs are absent and pulmonary function tests are normal, this abnormal finding indicates subclinical alveolitis. It is still not clear whether such subclinical alveolitis needs treatment. It is also not clear whether the pattern of BAL cells (increase in neutrophils or lymphocytes) in a setting of subclinical alveolitis reflects the prognosis [32]. </p><p> </p><p>9. Role of BAL in the prognosis and activity of disease </p><p>It is unclear whether BAL cellularity is useful for assessing the activity of disease processes with respect to obtaining prognostic information. In sarcoidosis, differences were observed for several BAL parameters between clinically active and inactive patient groups, but without predicting long-term outcome in individual patients. It is not proven that BAL or serial BAL is useful to guide therapy or predict treatment response. At present, BAL cannot be routinely recommended for this purpose. </p><p>10. Role of BAL in research and development of new drugs </p><p>The discovery of new signal pathways and biomarkers between cells and the application of proteomics, gene arrays and metabolomics has contributed many important insights into the pathogenesis of respiratory tract diseases. BAL has been profiled as a fundamental method to obtaining alveolar space and airway specimens for research, and this could lead to more clear-cut longitudinal monitoring of ILD in the future. For example, KL-6, a high-molecular weight glycoprotein predominantly expressed on the surface of alveolar type II cells, is a promising biomarker in the field of ILD. Increased levels of KL-6 in BAL fluid and plasma correlate with the severity of alveolar inflammation and poor survival in acute respiratory distress syndrome [33]. Increased levels of KL-6 in both BAL fluid and blood, with a strong correlation between BAL and blood, also reflect disease severity in patients with idiopathic pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [34]. BAL is suitable for studying the cellular and biological changes induced by drugs. In this view, BAL can be used for concept studies in the clinical development of new drugs. </p><p>11. Conclusion </p><p>Bronchoalveolar lavage is an easily performed and well tolerated procedure able to provide cellular contents, cellular products, and proteins from the lower respiratory tract. </p><p> </p><p>In the rapidly evolving field of pulmonary diagnostic tests, BAL has a specific value for the diagnosis of certain ILD's, such as alveolar proteinosis, Pneumocystis pneumonia, bronchoalveolar carcinoma, malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma and alveolar haemorrhage, allowing surgical lung biopsy to be avoided. In other ILD's, BAL findings may be able, in combination with clinical and HRCT findings, to strengthen or weaken a suspected diagnosis. This method is also valid support for research. Genetic and molecular biomarkers, with different diagnostic/prognostic significance, can be detected in BAL. </p><p>12. References </p><p>[1] Rankin, J. A. 1988. Pulmonary immunology. Clin.

Introduction\n\nThe lung is continuously exposed to the external environment and mixtures of complex antigens through the air. It is estimated that the resting human adult inhales 12,000 liters of air per day, while even mild physical activity can double or triple this amount (1). Protective immunity against inhaled antigens is mediated by the lymphocytes that are localized to the surface of the respiratory tract. The compartments in the lung where lymphocytes are present are (i) the epithelium and lamina propria of the air-conducting regions, (ii) the bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (found commonly in certain animals i.e. rabbit and rats) (iii) the pulmonary interstitium and vascular beds (iv) the bronchoalveolar space. In addition to anatomical barriers, such as airway angulation, mucociliary clearance, and coughing, both humoral and cellular defense mechanisms play an important role in maintaining the viability of the host. One of the first lines of defense against particulate matter is mucociliary clearance and phagocytic activity of alveolar macrophages. Antigens entering the pulmonary tract encounter antigen-presenting cells comprised of alveolar and interstitial macrophages and effector T lymphocytes.\n\n2. Bronchoalveolar lavage for diagnosis of various respiratory disorders\n\nBronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is an important tool for the diagnosis of pulmonary infections and malignancies. Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy is a relatively safe and minimally invasive means by which to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). It is usually well tolerated by patients and can be performed safely even on those patients who are quite ill.\n\nThe diagnostic and prognostic utility of BAL was first evaluated in the 1980s (2). The investigatory technique of BAL has become one of the most valuable research tools for studying inflammatory mechanisms in a wide range of diseases that affect the lungs and airways in humans. In addition, cytological and microbiological testing of BAL samples are of established value for assisting in clinical diagnosis and management of many lung diseases, and these procedures are available routinely.\n\nSince the introduction of the rigid bronchoscope by Dr. Jackson in 1904, BAL is a diagnostic procedure in which a fiber-optic bronchoscope is passed through the mouth or nose into the lung and fluid is put into a small part of the lung and then recollected for examination.\n\nBronchoalveolar lavage is typically performed to diagnose lung disease. Primarily, BAL was used as a treatment for patients who suffered from diseases associated with accumulation of purulent secretions such as alveolar proteinosis, cystic fibrosis and bacterial pneumonia (3).\n\n3. Definition\n\nBy definition BAL is a method for the recovery of cellular and non-cellular components from the lower respiratory tract (e.g. alveoli) (4). It is a safe technique, with few major complications (5). In many cases (e.g. pulmonary proteinosis, alveolar hemorrhage, eosinophilic pneumonia) BAL can replace lung biopsy (6). Possible uses of BAL in diagnostics are summarized in following table\n\nNon-infectious Infectious\n\nSarcoidosis (Ventilator-associated) pneumonia\n\nHypersensitivity pneumonitis Pneumocystis pneumonia\n\nIdiopatic lung fibrosis Mycobacterial infection\n\nConnective tissue disorders Aspergillus fumigatus infection\n\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis Viral pneumonia\n\nMalignancies Toxoplasma pneumonia\n\nAlveolar hemorrhage Legionella infection\n\nAlveolar proteinosis Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia\n\nEosinophilic pneumonia Chlamydia pneumoniae pneumonia\n\nBronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia Cryptococcal infection\n\nAsbestosis Histoplasma infection\n\nSilicosis Strongyloides infection\n\nTable 1. Pulmonary diseases where BALF can be used to a diagnosis (7, 8, 9).\n\n4. Procedure\n\nBronchoalveolar Lavage is a minimally invasive technique which is used to obtain cells, inhaled particles, infectious organisms and solutes from the alveolar spaces of the lung. To achieve this, a sufficient volume of lavage fluid must be instilled to ensure a sufficient aspirate. In adults, a minimum of 100 mL of lavage fluid should be instilled. Besides diagnostic BAL, there are other lavage techniques are used and they differ in the following ways: 1) Bronchial lavage (or bronchial washing) requires relatively little instilled fluid (10-30 mL) and samples from large airways for bacteriological study and/or tumour cytology; 2) therapeutic lavage usees small volumes and is used to remove sticky bronchial secretions in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis; and 3) whole lung lavage is performed in order to wash out an entire lung in patients with alveolar proteinosis, which requires repeated instillation of 1 L of fluid (in total 10-40 L for each lung) through a double-lumen endotracheal tube during general anaesthesia.\n\nBAL is usually performed during fibreoptic bronchoscopy with topical anaesthetic after general inspection of the tracheobronchial tree. BAL can also be performed under general anaesthesia and in ventilated patients through a rigid bronchoscope or an endotracheal tube.\n\n5. Site of bronchoalveolar lavage\n\nThe site of lavage depends on the localization of the abnormalities. In case of localized disease, for instance an infection with a radiographically apparent infiltrate or a malignancy, the involved segment should be sampled (10). In diffuse lung disease, the middle lobe or lingular lobe is commonly used as a standard site for BAL. This is often the most accessible site and the fluid obtained at one site is representative of the whole lung in diffuse lung diseases (11). If anatomical difficulties are encountered in both lobes the anterior segment of either the upper or lower lobe may be used. Using the method described, approximately 1.5-3% of the lung (approximately 1,000,000 alveoli) are sampled (4).\n\nUsually, the lavage is performed using sterile, unbuffered isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl) solution and preferably the saline is preheated to body-temperature (37ºC) to help prevent coughing and increase cellular yield (12). The volume varies between 100 and 300 ml in aliquots of 20 to 50 ml (13). The ERS task force recommended the use of 200-240 ml divided in four aliquots.\n\n5.1 Fluid instillation and recovery\n\nThe fluid is instilled with syringes through the biopsy channel of bronchoscope and immediately recovered by applying suction (25-100 mmHg), using a standard number of input aliquots of 20-60 mL (commonly four to five aliquots are recommended) up to a total volume of 100-300 mL. Smaller instilled volumes (<100 mL) increase the likelihood of contamination by the bronchial spaces, including inflammatory cells derived from the larger airways, which may skew the differential cell counts [14].\n\nThe first aspirated volume is normally smaller than the following ones. Usually, 40-70% of the instilled volume is recovered. In obstructive airway disease and emphysema the recovery rate is significantly lower and may be <30%. The yield is also reduced in healthy smokers and the elderly. In addition, fluid recovery may be low with a poor wedge position leading to leakage of lavage fluid around the bronchoscope, which is associated with cough. Differential evaluation of the ''bronchial'' (first aliquot) and ''alveolar'' (subsequent aliquots) samples may be useful in airway diseases. Siliconised or plastic containers should be used for collection and processing of BAL fluid to avoid loss of cells through adhesion to glass surfaces.\n\n6. Safety aspects\n\nThe BAL procedure is practically associated with no mortality and carries a low complication rate of 0-2.3% [15-17]. After BAL procedure there is fever in some hours and a transient decrease in lung function parameters, both usually self-limited and resolving within 24 h. These are the most frequent adverse effects and occur in 3-30% of patients, depending on the instilled volume. Other adverse effects include short-lasting alveolar infiltration, wheezing and bronchospasm in patients with hyper-reactive airways. Major or late complications are only seen in patients with severe lung or heart disease, and bleeding has only been reported in patients with clotting disorders or thrombocytopenia. Risk factors for developing adverse effects are: 1) extensive pulmonary infiltrates, an arterial oxygen tension <8.0 kPa (<60 mmHg) and an oxygen saturation <90%; 2) a forced expiratory volume in 1 s <1.0 L; 3) prothrombin time >50 s and platelet counts <20,000 platelets/mL; 4) significant comorbidity; and 5) bronchial hyperreactivity.\n\n6.1 Quality control of BALF\n\nTo ensure that the obtained material represents the situation in the alveoli, a number of criteria have been established. A BALF is regarded non-representative if it fulfills one of the following criteria: i) volume <20 ml, ii) total cell count <60,000 cells/ml, iii) presence of >1% squamous epithelial cells, iv) presence of >5% bronchial epithelial cells, v) presence of extensive amounts of debris, vi) severely damaged cell morphology.\n\n6.2 Specimen processing\n\nThe total fluid recovered is kept at room temperature and should be transported to the laboratory within 1 hr because the cells are not well preserved in the saline solution. The fluid should be pooled into a single container and total volume should be measured. The lavage fluid frequently contains large amounts of mucus; therefore, filtration through cotton gauze or nylon mesh is often performed. Filtration leads to a preferential loss of bronchial epithelial cells without a significant effect on the total cell count and cell differentials. After filtration, the fluid is centrifuged for 10 min at 500g and after this the supernatant can be stored at -20°C or -70°C for subsequent analysis of soluble components. The total number of cells is counted in a haemocytometer, either in a sample of the pooled native fluid or in a resuspension of the cells after the first centrifugation. Washing procedures result in a loss of total cell count but lead to an increase in cell viability of the remaining cells. The total cell count is usually expressed as the total number of cells recovered per lavage but also as the concentration of cells per mL of recovered fluid. Cell viability is assessed by trypan blue exclusion and should range from 80% to 95% [18, 19].\n\nFor the enumeration of cell differentials, at least 600 cells are counted on cytocentrifuge or cell smear preparations after staining with May-Grunwald-Giemsa stain. A high percentage of epithelial cells (>5%) is indicative of contamination of the alveolar samples by bronchial cells. At least three unstained slides should be stored so that special stains (iron, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), silver, toluidine blue, fat or Ziehl-Neelsen) can be performed as per need.\n\nBesides these routine investigations, further work-up can be performed as needed. For example, if a tumor is suspected the Papanicolau stain can be applied. If infection is suspected, a complete microbiological assessment, including cultures, should be performed. To document asbestos exposure, quantitative determination of asbestos bodies can be made after vacuum filtration of the native BAL fluid through a 0.45-1.2 µm Millipore membrane. The exact dust composition can be determined by electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry. Lymphocyte subpopulations can be identified by immunocytochemical methods, immunofluorescence or flow cytometry using monoclonal antibody techniques [20].\n\nThese investigations are not recommended as a routine procedure for all BAL specimens. They are indicated in cases with high lymphocyte counts, such as extrinsic allergic alveolitis, or if Langerhans cell histiocytosis is suspected CD3. CD4, CD8, CD20 and markers of T-cell activation can be determined. CD1a or Langerin are very specific markers of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Flow cytometry is also a useful tool to detect markers of malignant lymphoma [21].\n\nThere are some studies also performed for research purposes including functional studies of viable BAL cells, cell cultivation in appropriate culture medium and determination of mediators along with the mechanisms that appear to regulate the mediator release. Cells can also be probed with molecular biology to investigate gene activation and intracellular signaling pathways.\n\n7. Normal values of BAL in healthy volunteers\n\nThe BAL fluid obtained from healthy, nonsmoking adults without lung disease contains only small percentages of lymphocytes, neutrophils and other inflammatory cells; alveolar macrophages are the predominant cell population (80-90%) (fig. 1a). Differential cell count in healthy non-smokers have been reported to show macrophages >80%, lymphocytes ≤15%, neutrophils ≤3%, eosinophils ≤0.5%, and mast cells ≤0.5%.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFig. 1. Bronchoalveolar lavage in a) a healthy nonsmoker and b) a healthy smoker [22].\n\nCigarette smoking is a strong confounding factor with significant effects on BAL samples. The alveolar macrophages from smokers show a 3 to 5 fold increase and characteristic morphology: many of them are much larger than those in nonsmokers and contain cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (smoker's inclusion bodies) consisting of tar products, lipids, lipofuscin and other substances (fig. 1b).\n\n7.1 BAL in the diagnosis of diffuse parenchymal lung disease\n\nBAL is indicated in every patient with nuclear pulmonary shadowing or interstitial lung disease (ILD). BAL findings may be very specific, so that they can directly confirm a particular diagnosis. BAL should not be considered as a stand-alone diagnostic test and should be interpreted in the context of clinical, laboratory and radiographical high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) findings. It has been used in diagnostic and prognostic evaluation in diffuse parenchymal lung disease for three decades and has a central role in the diagnosis of a number of rare disorders and in excluding opportunistic infection in treated patients. It also has an important role in the diagnosis of many prevalent disorders, including sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\n\n7.2 Specific BAL findings in rare diseases\n\n7.2.1 Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis\n\nPulmonary alveolar proteinosis is one of the few diseases in which BAL can confirm the diagnosis and replace lung biopsy. In pulmonary alveolar protienosis the BAL fluid is macroscopically milky and turbid. Under light microscopy the characteristic acellular oval bodies (surfactant derived lipoproteins) are basophilic on May-Grunwald-Giemsa staining and positive with PAS staining. The background is occupied by large amounts of amorphous debris showing weak PAS staining and a few foamy macrophages [21].\n\n7.2.2 Langerhans cell histiocytosis\n\nPulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis is strongly associated with cigarette smoking, and the BAL differential shows the typical smoker's constellation with increased total cell counts and macrophages with smoker's inclusions. The specific finding is an increase in Langerhans cells to >4% of the total BAL cell count. The sensitivity is low because in late cases of the disease the number of Langerhans cells decrease in the tissue. Low proportions of Langerhans cells in the range of 2-4% can be seen in other conditions, such as in healthy smokers, respiratory bronchiolitis/interstitial lung disease (RB/ILD), other ILD and bronchioalveolar carcinoma [21]. The Langerhans cells can be easily identified in BAL by their staining with the monoclonal antibody for CD1a or Langerin [23]. The intracytoplasmic reaction with polyclonal antibody S100 is not as specific. As in alveolar proteinosis, electronic microscopy is not recommended as a routine diagnostic procedure.\n\n7.2.3 Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage\n\nDiffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) is a clinical syndrome with widespread bleeding into the alveolar space as a result of multiple causes. The demonstration of numerous haemosiderin-laden macrophages on BAL cytology enables a diagnosis to be made even in cases with occult bleeding. In patients with fresh bleeding episodes free red blood cells in the fluid and fragments of ingested red blood cells within the cytoplasm of macrophages are pathognomonic.\n\nTo asses the severity of bleeding, the percentage of siderophages can easily be counted. It has been shown that a percentage of siderophages ≥20% is sufficient for a diagnosis of DAH.\n\nMany syndromes belong to this group and other clinical and laboratory findings must be investigated to establish the cause of the bleeding. In the clinical setting, chronic left heart failure with pulmonary congestion is one of the most frequent underlying conditions for the finding of DAH in BAL fluid examination. Endogenous bleeding has to be differentiated from exogenous iron load of the lungs. Exogenous siderosis does not show roundish fragments of erythrocytes but irregular shaped dust particles engulfed by macrophages.\n\n7.2.4 Chronic aspiration\n\nIn the differential diagnosis of recurrent pneumonia, gastro-oesophageal reflux with aspiration needs to be considered. The BAL cell differential may show a mixed pattern with increase in lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils. The characteristic diagnostic finding is the presence of large numbers of lipid-laden macrophages and is highly suggestive of lipoid pneumonia caused by chronic aspiration.\n\n7.2.5 Pneumoconioses\n\nIn ILD due to mineral dust exposure, BAL can confirm exposure by the detection of dust particles in alveolar macrophages. It is of two types:\n\na. Asbestos-related disease: Asbestos bodies in BAL fluid can be detected by smear technique or cytocentrifuge technique. However quantification of asbestos bodies by a specific Millipore filtration is a more sensitive technique. The results are expressed as number of asbestos bodies per mL of BAL fluid, which shows a relatively good correlation with the asbestos body count in lung tissue analysis. However, 10-15% of subjects with known occupational asbestos exposure may have no detectable asbestos bodies in their BAL fluid. Thus, a negative BAL asbestos body count does not exclude asbestos-related disease.\n\nb. Chronic beryllium disease: This condition is clinically, radiologically and histologically identical to sarcoidosis and in this condition BAL lymphocytes have an increase in the CD4/CD8 ratio . Because the antigen is known, a diagnostic in vitro lymphocyte transformation test can be performed. Lymphocytes from blood or BAL fluid are incubated with beryllium salts and the beryllium-specific proliferation of the lymphocytes is quantified. A positive lymphocyte transformation test of BAL T-cells to beryllium salts is highly sensitive and specific (definitely more sensitive than the blood test) and always recommended in doubtful cases to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n7.2.6 Eosinophilic lung disease\n\nEosinophilic lung disease can be diagnosed when there are ≥25% eosinophils in BAL of the radiologically affected segment. In both acute and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia the fraction of BAL eosinophils ranges from 20% to 90% and is higher than the neutrophil fraction. In this condition a mild-to-moderate increase in lymphocyte count with a decrease in CD4/CD8 ratio can be observed. In combination with clinical and HRCT findings, eosinophilic lung diseases can be appropriately diagnosed by BAL alone without an open lung biopsy [21].\n\n7.2.7 Opportunistic infections\n\nBAL has achieved the greatest diagnostic value among immunocompromised patients with pulmonary infiltrates. The sensitivity of BAL ranges from 60-90% in the diagnosis of bacterial infections, 70-80% in mycobacterial, fungal and most viral infections, and from 90- 95% in Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. The characteristic cysts of Pneumocystis can be detected on May-Grunwald-Giemsa stained slides.\n\nIn cytomegalovirus pneumonia, the characteristic cytomegalic-transformed cell (the owl eye cell) with typical nuclear or cytoplasmic inclusions is highly specific and can be seen on light microscopy in 30-50% of cases.\n\n7.2.8 Malignancies\n\nBAL is not as sensitive for solid tumours as biopsy and cytology techniques. Diffuse malignant infiltrates can be reliably diagnosed in 60-90% of cases. The highest yield is seen in widespread malignancies, such as primary bronchoalveolar carcinoma or lymphangitic carcinomatosis due to adenocarcinoma. It can also provide diagnostic cytological material in haematological malignancies of the lung, including Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukaemia, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia, myeloma and mycosis fungoides. In malignant B-cell lymphoma the immunocytological demonstration of a monoclonal B-cell population, expressing only one immunoglobulin type and either kappa or lambda light chains, can confirm the diagnosis of malignancy [24, 25].\n\n8. BAL as an adjunct to diagnosis\n\nThere are no specific BAL findings in the more common interstitial lung diseases. However, when BAL cellular analysis is considered in the context of clinical and HRCT findings it may contribute to narrowing the differential diagnosis and to avoiding open lung biopsy. BAL cellular patterns can generally differentiate the fibrosing conditions (characterised by neutrophilia and eosinophilia) from granulomatous diseases (lymphocytosis with or without granulocytosis).\n\n8.1 Sarcoidosis\n\nIn sarcoidosis, BAL shows lymphocytic alveolitis in 90% of patients at the time of diagnosis, independent of the stage of sarcoidosis. It was shown that the patients with active sarcoidosis have a tendency to show higher lymphocyte counts than those with inactive sarcoidosis. However, in the late stage of sarcoidosis neutrophils may also be increased, as well as the number of mast cells. Patients with primary extrathoracic sarcoidosis may show typical findings of sarcoidosis on BAL even when imaging findings are normal [26]. The CD4/CD8 ratio also has high variability in sarcoidosis and approximately only 55% of patients show an increased CD4/CD8 ratio at the time of diagnosis. The ratio is even decreased to 1.0 in 15% of patients. The CD4/CD8 ratio is especially high in patients with Lofgren syndrome and acute sarcoidosis. Some studies have demonstrated an increased neutrophil count in BAL obtained from newly diagnosed patients with sarcoidosis.\n\n8.2 Extrinsic allergic alveolitis\n\nThis disease shows the highest total cell count and the highest lymphocyte count of all ILD's. The total cell yield is usually >20 million from a 100-mL BAL, with the proportion of lymphocytes exceeding 50%. The number of activated T-cells is also increased. The assessment of the CD4/CD8 ratio has produced contradictory findings. It is a general belief that the CD4/CD8 ratio is decreased. However, more recent studies have demonstrated that the ratio may be decreased, normal or increased [27, 28]. The alveolar macrophages are heterogeneous and often show a foamy cytoplasm. In acute episodes of extrinsic allergic alveolitis, the neutrophil count may increase transiently for approximately one week. A normal cell appearance or an isolated increase in neutrophil or eosinophil count widely excludes extrinsic allergic alveolitis.\n\n8.3 Drug induced pneumonitis\n\nThere are a large number of drugs which may induce an ILD, mediated by either toxic or immunological mechanisms (Table 2) [29]. Along with BAL lymphocytosis and/or granulocytosis, cytotoxic reactions with atypical type II pneumocytes or diffuse alveolar haemorrhage may be observed. The most frequent finding is lymphocytic alveolitis with a dominance of CD8+ T-cells. Methotrexate-induced pneumonitis may show an increase in CD4+ cells. Characteristic changes in amiodarone-induced pneumonitis are the presence of alveolar macrophages with a finely vacuolated foamy cytoplasm. These are also seen in patients without clinical signs of ILD. If no foamy macrophages are found, amiodarone-induced pneumonitis can probably be excluded. The BAL findings described are not specific for drug-induced lung disease; therefore, additional assessment including tests like anti-histone antibody is necessary to make the diagnosis.\n\n8.4 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other idiopathic interstitial pneumonias\n\nThe typical BAL findings in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a moderately increased neutrophil count (10-30% of the total cells), with or without an increased eosinophil count. In total, 70-90% of the patients show an increased neutrophil count, while 40-60% shows an additionally increased eosinophil count. In 10-20% of the patients, a moderately increased lymphocyte count (proportion <30%) is seen .\n\nIn nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), a BAL lymphocytosis with a mild increase in the neutrophil and eosinophil count can be seen [30]. A BAL lymphocytosis is likely to be found more frequently in cellular NSIP than in fibrotic NSIP. The BAL findings in cellular NSIP appear to resemble those in bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP).\n\nIn acute interstitial pneumonia the histological finding of diffuse alveolar damage shows an extremely unfavourable prognosis. The BAL fluid in acute interstitial pneumonia is mostly bloody and rich in albumin, indicating increased alveolar capillary permeability.

Bronchoalveolar lavage findings in drug-induced interstitial lung disease\n\ncellular BAL finding is a marked increase in neutrophils and an occasional increase in lymphocytes. Atypical pneumocytes mimicking adenocarcinoma and fragmented hyaline membranes may also be observed [25]. The typical BAL findings in desquamative interstitial pneumonia and RB/ILD are an increase in macrophages with black pigmented inclusions. In this an increase in neutrophils, eosinophils and, occasionally, lymphocytes may also be seen. Idiopathic lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia is rare and is usually associated with collagen vascular diseases, Sjogren's syndrome or lymphoma. The typical BAL finding in lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia is lymphocytosis and CD4/CD8 ratio shows diverse alterations.\n\n8.5 Collagen vascular disease\n\nIn collagen vascular diseases (CVD), pulmonary involvement can be associated with various histopathological patterns. The pathology may be similar to IPF with a usual interstitial pneumonia pattern, but many of the cases of CVD-associated pulmonary fibrosis show a pattern that is in the category of NSIP, based on a computed tomography scan or histology [26]. The BAL findings are also somewhat different from IPF. The general pattern is increased neutrophils, with or without eosinophils, but increased lymphocytes are more commonly seen than in IPF [31]. In general, BAL seems to have a limited value in the diagnosis of CVD affecting the lungs because the BAL profile is very nonspecific. However, BAL may be useful in detecting other pulmonary problems that may arise in these disorders, including drug induced toxicity, infection, pulmonary haemorrhage associated with vasculitis and malignancy. The NSIP pattern was the more prevalent pattern. It has previously been shown that increased BAL neutrophils were associated with more extensive changes on HRCT. An abnormal BAL may be the first evidence of pulmonary involvement in CVD. If radiographic signs are absent and pulmonary function tests are normal, this abnormal finding indicates subclinical alveolitis. It is still not clear whether such subclinical alveolitis needs treatment. It is also not clear whether the pattern of BAL cells (increase in neutrophils or lymphocytes) in a setting of subclinical alveolitis reflects the prognosis [32].\n\n9. Role of BAL in the prognosis and activity of disease\n\nIt is unclear whether BAL cellularity is useful for assessing the activity of disease processes with respect to obtaining prognostic information. In sarcoidosis, differences were observed for several BAL parameters between clinically active and inactive patient groups, but without predicting long-term outcome in individual patients. It is not proven that BAL or serial BAL is useful to guide therapy or predict treatment response. At present, BAL cannot be routinely recommended for this purpose.\n\n10. Role of BAL in research and development of new drugs\n\nThe discovery of new signal pathways and biomarkers between cells and the application of proteomics, gene arrays and metabolomics has contributed many important insights into the pathogenesis of respiratory tract diseases. BAL has been profiled as a fundamental method to obtaining alveolar space and airway specimens for research, and this could lead to more clear-cut longitudinal monitoring of ILD in the future. For example, KL-6, a high-molecular weight glycoprotein predominantly expressed on the surface of alveolar type II cells, is a promising biomarker in the field of ILD. Increased levels of KL-6 in BAL fluid and plasma correlate with the severity of alveolar inflammation and poor survival in acute respiratory distress syndrome [33]. Increased levels of KL-6 in both BAL fluid and blood, with a strong correlation between BAL and blood, also reflect disease severity in patients with idiopathic pulmonary alveolar proteinosis [34]. BAL is suitable for studying the cellular and biological changes induced by drugs. In this view, BAL can be used for concept studies in the clinical development of new drugs.\n\n11. Conclusion\n\nBronchoalveolar lavage is an easily performed and well tolerated procedure able to provide cellular contents, cellular products, and proteins from the lower respiratory tract.\n\nIn the rapidly evolving field of pulmonary diagnostic tests, BAL has a specific value for the diagnosis of certain ILD's, such as alveolar proteinosis, Pneumocystis pneumonia, bronchoalveolar carcinoma, malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma and alveolar haemorrhage, allowing surgical lung biopsy to be avoided. In other ILD's, BAL findings may be able, in combination with clinical and HRCT findings, to strengthen or weaken a suspected diagnosis. This method is also valid support for research. Genetic and molecular biomarkers, with different diagnostic/prognostic significance, can be detected in BAL.\n\n12. References\n\n[1] Rankin, J. A. 1988. Pulmonary immunology. Clin.
